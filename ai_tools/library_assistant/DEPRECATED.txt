DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE
========================

This library_assistant folder is DEPRECATED and should not be used.

The functionality has been superseded by:
- Claude Code (claude.ai/code) for AI-assisted development
- Improved example notebooks and documentation in the main examples/ folder
- Comprehensive knowledge bases generated by ai_tools/generate_llm_knowledge_bases.py

This folder is excluded from all knowledge base generation and should be ignored
when working with ras-commander.

If you need AI assistance with ras-commander:
1. Use Claude Code with the repository's CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md guidance
2. Reference the knowledge bases in ai_tools/llm_knowledge_bases/
3. Review the example notebooks in examples/
