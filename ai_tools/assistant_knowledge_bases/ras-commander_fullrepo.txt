---

## Best Practices

### 1. RAS Object Usage

- **Single Project Scripts**:
  - Use the global `ras` object for simplicity.
    ```python
    from ras_commander import ras, init_ras_project

    init_ras_project("/path/to/project", "6.5")
    # Use ras object for operations
    ```

- **Multiple Projects**:
  - Create separate `RasPrj` instances for each project.
    ```python
    from ras_commander import RasPrj, init_ras_project

    project1 = init_ras_project("/path/to/project1", "6.5", ras_instance=RasPrj())
    project2 = init_ras_project("/path/to/project2", "6.5", ras_instance=RasPrj())
    ```

- **Consistency**:
  - Avoid mixing global and custom RAS objects in the same script.

### 2. Plan Specification

- Use plan numbers as strings (e.g., `"01"`, `"02"`) for consistency.
  ```python
  RasCmdr.compute_plan("01")
  ```

- Check available plans before specifying plan numbers.
  ```python
  print(ras.plan_df)  # Displays available plans
  ```

### 3. Geometry Preprocessor Files

- Clear geometry preprocessor files before significant changes.
  ```python
  RasGeo.clear_geompre_files()
  ```

- Use `clear_geompre=True` for a clean computation environment.
  ```python
  RasCmdr.compute_plan("01", clear_geompre=True)
  ```

### 4. Parallel Execution

- Adjust `max_workers` and `num_cores` based on system capabilities.
  ```python
  RasCmdr.compute_parallel(max_workers=4, num_cores=2)
  ```

- Use `dest_folder` to organize outputs and prevent conflicts.
  ```python
  RasCmdr.compute_parallel(dest_folder="/path/to/results")
  ```

### 5. Error Handling

- Implement try-except blocks to handle potential errors.
  ```python
  try:
      RasCmdr.compute_plan("01")
  except FileNotFoundError:
      print("Plan file not found")
  ```

- Utilize logging for informative output.
  ```python
  import logging
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
  ```

### 6. File Path Handling

- Use `pathlib.Path` for robust file and directory operations.
  ```python
  from pathlib import Path
  project_path = Path("/path/to/project")
  ```

### 7. Type Hinting

- Apply type hints to improve code readability and IDE support.
  ```python
  def compute_plan(plan_number: str, clear_geompre: bool = False) -> bool:
      ...
  ```

---

## Usage Patterns

### Initializing a Project
```python
from ras_commander import init_ras_project, ras

init_ras_project("/path/to/project", "6.5")
print(f"Working with project: {ras.project_name}")
```

### Cloning a Plan

```python
from ras_commander import RasPlan

new_plan_number = RasPlan.clone_plan("01")
print(f"Created new plan: {new_plan_number}")
```

### Executing Plans

- **Single Plan Execution**:
  ```python
  from ras_commander import RasCmdr

  success = RasCmdr.compute_plan("01", num_cores=2)
  print(f"Plan execution {'successful' if success else 'failed'}")
  ```

- **Parallel Execution of Multiple Plans**:
  ```python
  from ras_commander import RasCmdr

  results = RasCmdr.compute_parallel(
      plan_numbers=["01", "02", "03"],
      max_workers=3,
      num_cores=4,
      dest_folder="/path/to/results",
      clear_geompre=True
  )

  for plan, success in results.items():
      print(f"Plan {plan}: {'Successful' if success else 'Failed'}")
  ```

### Working with Multiple Projects

```python
from ras_commander import RasPrj, init_ras_project, RasCmdr

# Initialize two separate projects
project1 = init_ras_project("/path/to/project1", "6.5", ras_instance=RasPrj())
project2 = init_ras_project("/path/to/project2", "6.5", ras_instance=RasPrj())

# Perform operations on each project
RasCmdr.compute_plan("01", ras_object=project1)
RasCmdr.compute_plan("02", ras_object=project2)

# Compare results
results1 = project1.get_hdf_entries()
results2 = project2.get_hdf_entries()
```

### Performance Optimization

```python
from ras_commander import RasCmdr

results = RasCmdr.compute_parallel(
    plan_numbers=["01", "02", "03"],
    max_workers=3,
    num_cores=4,
    dest_folder="/path/to/results",
    clear_geompre=True
)

for plan, success in results.items():
    print(f"Plan {plan}: {'Successful' if success else 'Failed'}")
```

- **Best Practices**:
  - Use `compute_parallel()` for concurrent plan execution.
  - Adjust `max_workers` and `num_cores` based on system capabilities.
  - Organize outputs with `dest_folder`.
  - Use `clear_geompre=True` for clean computations.

### Working with Boundary Conditions

```python
from ras_commander import init_ras_project

# Initialize a project
project = init_ras_project("/path/to/project", "6.5")

# Access boundary conditions
boundary_conditions = project.boundaries_df

# Display boundary condition information
print(boundary_conditions)

# Filter boundary conditions for a specific river
river_boundaries = boundary_conditions[boundary_conditions['river_reach_name'] == 'Main River']
print(river_boundaries)
```

### Using RasUtils Statistical Methods

```python
from ras_commander import RasUtils
import numpy as np

# Example observed and predicted values
observed = np.array([100, 120, 140, 160, 180])
predicted = np.array([105, 125, 135, 165, 175])

# Calculate error metrics
metrics = RasUtils.calculate_error_metrics(observed, predicted)

print(f"Correlation: {metrics['cor']:.4f}")
print(f"RMSE: {metrics['rmse']:.4f}")
print(f"Percent Bias: {metrics['pb']:.4f}")

# Calculate individual metrics
rmse = RasUtils.calculate_rmse(observed, predicted)
percent_bias = RasUtils.calculate_percent_bias(observed, predicted, as_percentage=True)

print(f"RMSE: {rmse:.4f}")
print(f"Percent Bias: {percent_bias:.2f}%")
```

print(f"Steady Flow projects: {steady_flow_projects}")

# Extract specific projects
extracted_paths = ras_examples.extract_project(["Bald Eagle Creek", "Muncie"])
for path in extracted_paths:
    print(f"Extracted project to: {path}")

# Clean up extracted projects when done
ras_examples.clean_projects_directory()
```

### RasUtils

The `RasUtils` class provides utility functions for common tasks in the `ras_commander` library.

#### Key Concepts

- **File and Directory Operations**: Create, delete, and manage files and directories.
- **Backup and Restoration**: Safeguard original files with backups.
- **Error Handling and Retries**: Robust methods to handle common file system errors.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform calculations such as RMSE, correlation, and percent bias.

#### Usage Patterns

```python
from ras_commander import RasUtils
from pathlib import Path

# Create a backup of a file
original_file = Path("project.prj")
backup_file = RasUtils.create_backup(original_file)

# Ensure a directory exists
output_dir = RasUtils.create_directory(Path("output"))

# Find files by extension
prj_files = RasUtils.find_files_by_extension(".prj")

# Get file information
file_size = RasUtils.get_file_size(original_file)
mod_time = RasUtils.get_file_modification_time(original_file)

# Update a plan file
RasUtils.update_plan_file("01", "Geom", 2)

# Remove a file or folder with retry logic
RasUtils.remove_with_retry(Path("temp_folder"), is_folder=True)
```

Certainly! I'll expand the Comprehensive Library Guide with more detailed information on RAS Objects, project initialization, file handling, and consistent file path management. Here's an enhanced version of those sections:

# Comprehensive RAS-Commander Library Guide

## Key Concepts

### RAS Objects

RAS Objects are central to the ras-commander library. They represent HEC-RAS projects and contain all the necessary information about plans, geometries, flow files, and other project components.

1. **Global 'ras' Object**: 
   - By default, the library uses a global 'ras' object.
   - This object is automatically initialized when you call `init_ras_project()`.
   - Suitable for simple scripts working with a single project.

2. **Custom RAS Objects**:
   - For more complex scenarios or when working with multiple projects, you can create custom RAS objects.
   - These are instances of the `RasPrj` class.
   - Allow you to manage multiple projects simultaneously.

3. **Key Attributes of RAS Objects**:
   - `project_folder`: Path to the project folder
   - `prj_file`: Path to the project file
   - `project_name`: Name of the project
   - `ras_exe_path`: Path to the HEC-RAS executable
   - `plan_df`: DataFrame containing plan information
   - `geom_df`: DataFrame containing geometry information
   - `flow_df`: DataFrame containing flow information
   - `unsteady_df`: DataFrame containing unsteady flow information

4. **Importance of Initialization**:
   - RAS objects must be initialized before use.
   - Initialization loads all project data and sets up necessary attributes.
   - Always check if a RAS object is initialized before performing operations.

Example of using custom RAS objects:

```python
from ras_commander import init_ras_project, RasPrj

project1 = init_ras_project("/path/to/project1", "6.5", ras_instance=RasPrj())
project2 = init_ras_project("/path/to/project2", "6.5", ras_instance=RasPrj())

# Now you can work with project1 and project2 independently
```

### Project Initialization and File Handling

Proper project initialization is crucial for the correct functioning of the ras-commander library. The `init_ras_project()` function is the primary method for setting up a project.

1. **Project Initialization Process**:
   - Locates the project folder and HEC-RAS executable
   - Finds the main project file (.prj)
   - Loads all plan, geometry, and flow file information
   - Sets up DataFrames for easy access to project components

2. **File Discovery**:
   - The library automatically scans the project folder for relevant files
   - Files are categorized based on their extensions (e.g., .p* for plans, .g* for geometries)
   - File information is stored in respective DataFrames (plan_df, geom_df, etc.)

3. **Error Handling During Initialization**:
   - Checks for the existence of the project folder and necessary files
   - Raises informative errors if critical components are missing

4. **Post-Initialization**:
   - After initialization, you can access project information through the RAS object
   - Always check if the RAS object is initialized before performing operations

Example of project initialization:

```python
from ras_commander import init_ras_project, ras

init_ras_project("/path/to/project", "6.5")

# Now you can use the global 'ras' object
print(ras.project_name)
print(ras.plan_df)
```

### Consistent File Path Management

Consistent file path management is critical for reliable operation across different operating systems and environments. The ras-commander library uses `pathlib.Path` for all file and directory operations.

1. **Why Use pathlib.Path**:
   - Operating system independent
   - Provides an object-oriented interface for file path operations
   - Simplifies path manipulation and file operations

2. **Best Practices**:
   - Always use `Path` objects for file and directory paths
   - Use forward slashes ('/') in path strings, which work across all operating systems
   - Use relative paths when possible for better portability

3. **Path Resolution**:
   - The library resolves relative paths to absolute paths during initialization
   - Always work with absolute paths after initialization to avoid ambiguity

4. **Examples from the Library**:

```python
from pathlib import Path

# In RasPrj.py
self.project_folder = Path(project_folder)
self.prj_file = self.find_ras_prj(self.project_folder)

# In RasUtils.py
def create_backup(file_path: Path, backup_suffix: str = "_backup") -> Path:
    original_path = Path(file_path)
    backup_path = original_path.with_name(f"{original_path.stem}{backup_suffix}{original_path.suffix}")
    # ... rest of the function

# In user scripts
from ras_commander import init_ras_project, RasUtils

init_ras_project(Path("/path/to/project"), "6.5")
RasUtils.create_backup(Path("project.prj"))
```

5. **Handling User Input**:
   - When accepting file paths from users, always convert them to Path objects
   - Use `Path(user_input).resolve()` to get the absolute path

6. **Working with Multiple Projects**:
   - Keep paths relative to each project's base directory
   - Use `Path.relative_to()` when needed to get relative paths

By following these practices for file path management, you ensure that your scripts using the ras-commander library will work consistently across different systems and project structures.

## Approaching Your End User Needs with Ras Commander

### Understanding Data Sources and Strategies

RAS Commander is designed to work efficiently with HEC-RAS projects by focusing on easily accessible data sources. This approach allows for powerful automation while avoiding some of the complexities inherent in HEC-RAS data management. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Data Sources in HEC-RAS Projects**:
   - ASCII input files (plan files, unsteady files, boundary conditions)
   - DSS (Data Storage System) files for inputs
   - HDF (Hierarchical Data Format) files for outputs

2. **RAS Commander's Focus**:
   - Primarily works with plain text inputs and HDF outputs
   - Avoids direct manipulation of DSS files due to their complexity

3. **Strategy for Handling DSS Inputs**:
   - Run the plan or preprocess geometry and event conditions
   - Access the resulting HDF tables, which contain the DSS inputs in an accessible format
   - Define time series directly in the ASCII file instead of as DSS inputs

4. **Accessing Project Data**:
   - Basic project data is loaded from ASCII text files by the RasPrj routines
   - Plan details are available in the HDF file
   - Geometry data is in the dynamically generated geometry HDF file

### Working with RAS Commander

1. **Initialization and Data Loading**:
   - Use `init_ras_project()` to load project data from ASCII files
   - Access plan information from HDF files using provided functions

2. **Handling Geometry Data**:
   - Geometry data is dynamically generated in HDF format
   - Focus on working with the HDF geometry data rather than plain text editing

3. **Workflow for Complex Operations**:
   - Perform the desired operation manually once
   - Provide an example to RAS Commander's AI GPT of what you're changing and why
   - Use this example to develop project-specific functions and code

4. **Example: Replacing DSS-defined Boundary Conditions**:
   - Open the data in HDF View
   - Extract the relevant dataset
   - Manually enter the time series based on the HDF dataset
   - Verify the model works with this change
   - Use this example to create an automated function for similar operations

### Best Practices

1. **Understanding Your Data**:
   - Familiarize yourself with the structure of your HEC-RAS project
   - Identify which data is stored in ASCII, DSS, and HDF formats

2. **Leveraging HDF Outputs**:
   - Whenever possible, use HDF outputs for data analysis and manipulation
   - This approach provides easy access to data without DSS complexities

3. **Iterative Development**:
   - Start with manual operations to understand the process
   - Gradually automate these processes using RAS Commander functions
   - Always check with the HEC-RAS GUI to verify the changes before finalizing the automation

4. **Documentation**:
   - Keep detailed notes on your workflow and changes
   - This documentation will be invaluable for creating automated processes

5. **Flexibility**:
   - Be prepared to adapt your approach based on specific project needs
   - RAS Commander provides a framework, but project-specific solutions will always require custom scripting
   - With an AI assistant, you can quickly leverage this library or your own custom functions to automate your workflows.

By following these strategies and best practices, you can effectively use RAS Commander to automate and streamline your HEC-RAS workflows, working around limitations and leveraging the strengths of the library's approach to data management.


### Working with Boundary Conditions

The `RasPrj` class now provides detailed information about boundary conditions in HEC-RAS projects. This can be particularly useful for advanced analysis and automation tasks.

```python
from ras_commander import init_ras_project

project = init_ras_project("/path/to/project", "6.5")

# Get all boundary conditions
all_boundaries = project.boundaries_df

# Filter for specific boundary condition types
flow_hydrographs = all_boundaries[all_boundaries['bc_type'] == 'Flow Hydrograph']
stage_hydrographs = all_boundaries[all_boundaries['bc_type'] == 'Stage Hydrograph']

# Analyze boundary conditions
for _, boundary in flow_hydrographs.iterrows():
    print(f"River: {boundary['river_reach_name']}")
    print(f"Station: {boundary['river_station']}")
    print(f"Number of values: {boundary['hydrograph_num_values']}")
    print("---")

# Access specific boundary condition details
if 'hydrograph_values' in flow_hydrographs.columns:
    first_hydrograph = flow_hydrographs.iloc[0]['hydrograph_values']
    print("First 5 values of the first flow hydrograph:")
    print(first_hydrograph[:5])
```

### Advanced Data Processing with RasUtils

RasUtils now includes methods for data conversion and statistical analysis, which can be useful for post-processing HEC-RAS results.

```python
from ras_commander import RasUtils
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Convert various data sources to DataFrame
csv_data = RasUtils.convert_to_dataframe(Path("results.csv"))
excel_data = RasUtils.convert_to_dataframe(Path("data.xlsx"), sheet_name="Sheet1")

# Combine data from different sources
combined_data = pd.concat([csv_data, excel_data])

# Perform statistical analysis
observed = combined_data['observed_values'].values
predicted = combined_data['predicted_values'].values

metrics = RasUtils.calculate_error_metrics(observed, predicted)
print("Error Metrics:", metrics)

# Save results to Excel with retry functionality
results_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Metric': ['Correlation', 'RMSE', 'Percent Bias'],
    'Value': [metrics['cor'], metrics['rmse'], metrics['pb']]
})
RasUtils.save_to_excel(results_df, Path("analysis_results.xlsx"))
```

---

## RasHdf

The `RasHdf` class provides utilities for working with HDF (Hierarchical Data Format) files in HEC-RAS projects. HDF files are commonly used in HEC-RAS for storing large datasets and simulation results.

### Key Features of `RasHdf`:

1. **Reading HDF Tables**: Convert HDF5 datasets to pandas DataFrames.
2. **Writing DataFrames to HDF**: Save pandas DataFrames as HDF5 datasets.
3. **Spatial Operations**: Perform KDTree queries and find nearest neighbors.
4. **Data Consolidation**: Merge duplicate values in DataFrames.
5. **Byte String Handling**: Decode byte strings in DataFrames.

### Example Usage:

```python
from ras_commander import RasHdf
import h5py
import pandas as pd

# Read an HDF table
with h5py.File('results.hdf', 'r') as f:
    dataset = f['water_surface_elevations']
    df = RasHdf.read_hdf_to_dataframe(dataset)

print(df.head())

# Save a DataFrame to HDF
new_data = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': ['a', 'b', 'c']})
with h5py.File('new_results.hdf', 'w') as f:

## RasHdf class structure, methods, decorators, and their significance:

1. Class Structure:
   - RasHdf is a utility class designed to work with HDF files produced by HEC-RAS.
   - It contains only static methods, meaning no instance of the class needs to be created to use its functionality.
   - The class serves as a namespace for grouping related HDF file operations.

2. Primary Decorator:
   - @staticmethod: Used on all methods in the class.
   - Significance: Allows methods to be called on the class itself rather than an instance, fitting the utility nature of the class.

3. Custom Decorator:
   - @hdf_operation: A custom decorator defined within the RasHdf class.
   - Purpose: Provides a consistent way to handle HDF file operations, including error handling and file opening/closing.
   - Significance: Centralizes common HDF file handling logic, reducing code duplication and ensuring consistent error handling across methods.

4. Key Methods and Their Purposes:
   a. get_hdf_paths_with_properties(): Lists all paths in the HDF file with their properties.
   b. get_runtime_data(): Extracts runtime and compute time data.
   c. get_2d_flow_area_names(): Lists 2D Flow Area names.
   d. get_2d_flow_area_attributes(): Extracts 2D Flow Area attributes.
   e. get_cell_info(), get_cell_points(): Extract cell-related information.
   f. get_polygon_info_and_parts(), get_polygon_points(): Handle polygon data.
   g. get_cells_center_data(): Extracts cell center coordinates and Manning's n values.
   h. get_faces_area_elevation_data(): Extracts face area elevation data.
   i. load_2d_area_solutions(): Loads 2D area solutions including water surface elevations and velocities.
   j. Methods for infiltration and percent impervious data extraction.

5. Method Structure:
   - Most methods follow a pattern of accepting an hdf_input (which can be a plan number or file path) and an optional ras_object.
   - This structure allows flexibility in how the methods are called, supporting both plan-based and direct file path-based access.

6. Error Handling:
   - Centralized in the @hdf_operation decorator.
   - Catches and logs exceptions, returning None on failure.
   - Provides consistent error reporting across all HDF operations.

7. Flexibility in Usage:
   - Methods can be used with either a global RAS object, a custom RAS object, or by directly providing an HDF file path.
   - This flexibility allows the class to be used in various contexts within the larger ras-commander library.

8. Integration with RasPrj:
   - Many methods rely on the RasPrj class to resolve plan numbers to actual file paths.
   - This integration allows for a high-level, project-oriented approach to working with HDF data.

9. Data Extraction and Conversion:
   - Most methods extract data from the HDF file and convert it to pandas DataFrames.
   - This approach makes the extracted data easily manipulable using standard pandas operations.

10. Significance within the Library:
    - RasHdf serves as the primary interface for extracting and analyzing HEC-RAS output data.
    - It bridges the gap between raw HDF files and usable Python data structures.
    - Enables advanced analysis and post-processing of HEC-RAS results within the ras-commander ecosystem.

11. Extensibility:
    - The class structure allows for easy addition of new methods to support additional HDF data extraction as needed.
    - The @hdf_operation decorator makes it straightforward to add new HDF file operations while maintaining consistent error handling and file management.

12. Performance Considerations:
    - Methods are designed to work with potentially large datasets.
    - Some methods (like load_2d_area_solutions) may be memory-intensive for large models and may require optimization for very large datasets.

This structure makes RasHdf a powerful and flexible tool for working with HEC-RAS output data, providing a pythonic interface to the complex structure of HEC-RAS HDF files. Its integration with the broader ras-commander library allows for seamless incorporation of data analysis into HEC-RAS automation workflows.

## Optimizing Parallel Execution with RAS Commander

Efficient parallel execution is crucial for maximizing the performance of HEC-RAS simulations, especially when dealing with multiple plans or large models. RAS Commander offers several strategies for optimizing parallel execution based on your specific needs and system resources.  For more information about these strategies and how to optimize your hardware for HEC-RAS CPU based simulations, see the following blog posts: 

- [10x Engineering in Water Resources with AI](https://github.com/billk-FM/HEC-Commander/blob/main/Blog/1.%2010x%20Engineering%20in%20Water%20Resources%20with%20AI.md)
- [10X Engineering By The Numbers](https://github.com/billk-FM/HEC-Commander/blob/main/Blog/2.%2010XEngineering_By_The_Numbers.md)
- [Think Like A Bootlegger for HEC-RAS Modeling Machines](https://github.com/billk-FM/HEC-Commander/blob/main/Blog/4._Think_Like_A_Bootlegger_for_HEC-RAS_Modeling_Machines.md)
- [Benchmarking Is All You Need](https://github.com/billk-FM/HEC-Commander/blob/main/Blog/7._Benchmarking_Is_All_You_Need.md)
- [Avoiding The Bitter Lesson In RAS Modeling](https://github.com/billk-FM/HEC-Commander/blob/main/Blog/9.Avoiding_The_Bitter_Lesson_In_RAS_Modeling.md)


### Strategy 1: Efficiency Mode for Multiple Plans

This strategy maximizes overall throughput and efficiency when running multiple plans, although individual plan turnaround times may be longer.

**Key Points:**
- Use 2 real cores per plan
- Utilize only physical cores, not hyperthreaded cores

**Example:**
```python
from ras_commander import RasCmdr

# Assuming 8 physical cores on the system
RasCmdr.compute_parallel(
    plan_numbers=["01", "02", "03", "04"],
    max_workers=4,  # 8 cores / 2 cores per plan
    num_cores=2
)
```

### Strategy 2: Performance Mode for Single Plans

This strategy maximizes single plan performance by using more cores. It results in less overall efficiency but shortens single plan runtime, making it optimal for situations where individual plan performance is critical.

**Key Points:**
- Use 8-16 cores per plan, depending on system capabilities
- Suitable for running a single plan or a small number of high-priority plans

**Example:**
```python
from ras_commander import RasCmdr

RasCmdr.compute_plan(
    plan_number="01",
    num_cores=12  # Adjust based on your system's capabilities
)
```

### Strategy 3: Background Run Operation

This strategy balances performance and system resource usage, allowing for other operations to be performed concurrently.

**Key Points:**
- Limit total core usage to 50-80% of physical cores
- Combines aspects of Strategies 1 and 2
- Allows overhead for user to complete other operations while calculations are running

**Example:**
```python
import psutil
from ras_commander import RasCmdr

physical_cores = psutil.cpu_count(logical=False)
max_cores_to_use = int(physical_cores * 0.7)  # Using 70% of physical cores

RasCmdr.compute_parallel(
    plan_numbers=["01", "02", "03"],
    max_workers=max_cores_to_use // 2,
    num_cores=2
)
```

### Optimizing Geometry Preprocessing

To avoid repeated geometry preprocessing for each run, follow these steps:

1. **Preprocess Geometry:**
   ```python
   from ras_commander import RasPlan
   
   # For each plan you want to preprocess
   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, "Run HTab", 1)
   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, "Run UNet", -1)
   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, "Run PostProcess", -1)
   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, "Run RASMapper", -1)
   
   # Run the plan to preprocess geometry
   RasCmdr.compute_plan(plan_number)
   ```

2. **Run Simulations:**
   After preprocessing, update the flags for actual simulations:
   ```python
   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, "Run HTab", -1)
   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, "Run UNet", 1)
   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, "Run PostProcess", 1)
   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, "Run RASMapper", 0)
   ```

This approach preprocesses the geometry once, preventing redundant preprocessing when multiple plans use the same geometry.

### Best Practices for Parallel Execution

**Balance Cores:** Find the right balance between the number of parallel plans and cores per plan based on your system's capabilities.
**Consider I/O Operations:** Be aware that disk I/O can become a bottleneck in highly parallel operations.
**Test and Iterate:** Experiment with different configurations to find the optimal setup for your specific models and system.

By leveraging these strategies and best practices, you can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of your HEC-RAS simulations using RAS Commander.





## Troubleshooting

### 1. Project Initialization Issues

- **Ensure Correct Paths**: Verify that the project path is accurate and the `.prj` file exists.
- **HEC-RAS Version**: Confirm that the specified HEC-RAS version is installed on your system.

### 2. Execution Failures

- **File Existence**: Check that all referenced plan, geometry, and flow files exist.
- **Executable Path**: Ensure the HEC-RAS executable path is correctly set.
- **Log Files**: Review HEC-RAS log files for specific error messages.

### 3. Parallel Execution Problems

- **Resource Allocation**: Reduce `max_workers` if encountering memory issues.
- **System Capabilities**: Adjust `num_cores` based on your system's capacity.
- **Clean Environment**: Use `clear_geompre=True` to prevent conflicts.

### 4. File Access Errors

- **Permissions**: Verify read/write permissions for the project directory.
- **File Locks**: Close any open HEC-RAS instances that might lock files.

### 5. Inconsistent Results

- **Geometry Files**: Clear geometry preprocessor files when making changes.
- **Plan Parameters**: Ensure all plan parameters are correctly set before execution.

# RAS Commander (ras-commander)

RAS Commander is a Python library for automating HEC-RAS operations, providing a set of tools to interact with HEC-RAS project files, execute simulations, and manage project data. This library is an evolution of the RASCommander 1.0 Python Notebook Application previously released under the [HEC-Commander tools repository](https://github.com/billk-FM/HEC-Commander).

## Don't Ask Me, Ask ChatGPT!

Before you read any further, you can [chat directly with ChatGPT on this topic.](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-TZRPR3oAO-ras-commander-library-assistant)  Ask it anything, and it will use its tools to answer your questions and help you learn.  You can even upload your own plan, unsteady and HDF files to inspect and help determine how to automate your workflows or visualize your results. 

There are also [AI Assistant Knowledge Bases](https://github.com/billk-FM/ras-commander/tree/main/ai_tools/assistant_knowledge_bases) with various versions available to directly use with large context LLM models such as Anthropic's Claude, Google Gemini and OpenAI's GPT4o and o1 models.  

FUTURE:  TEMPLATES are available to use with AI Assistant Notebooks to build your own automation tools.  When used with large context models, these templates allow you to ask GPT to build a workflow from scratch to automate your projects. 

## Background
The ras-commander library emerged from the initial test-bed of AI-driven coding represented by the HEC-Commander tools Python notebooks. These notebooks served as a proof of concept, demonstrating the value proposition of automating HEC-RAS operations. The transition from notebooks to a structured library aims to provide a more robust, maintainable, and extensible solution for water resources engineers.

## Features

- Automate HEC-RAS project management and simulations
- Support for both single and multiple project instances
- Parallel execution of HEC-RAS plans
- Utilities for managing geometry, plan, and unsteady flow files
- Example project management for testing and development
- Two primary operation modes: "Run Missing" and "Build from DSS"

## AI-Driven Coding Experience

ras-commander provides several AI-powered tools to enhance the coding experience:

1. **ChatGPT Assistant: [RAS Commander Library Assistant](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-TZRPR3oAO-ras-commander-library-assistant)**: A specialized GPT model trained on the ras-commander codebase, available for answering queries and providing code suggestions.

2. **[Purpose-Built Knowledge Base Summaries](https://github.com/billk-FM/ras-commander/tree/main/ai_tools/assistant_knowledge_bases)**: Up-to-date compilations of the documentation and codebase for use with large language models like Claude or GPT-4. Look in 'ai_tools/assistant_knowledge_bases/' in the repo.

3. **[Cursor IDE Integration](https://github.com/billk-FM/ras-commander/blob/main/.cursorrules)**: Custom rules for the Cursor IDE to provide context-aware suggestions and documentation.  Just open the repository folder in Cursor.  You can create your own folders "/workspace/, "/projects/", or "my_projects/" as these are already in the .gitignore, and place your custom scripts there for your projects.  This will allow easy referencing of the ras-commander documents and individual repo files, the automatic loading of the .cursorrules file.  Alternatvely, download the github repo into your projects folder to easily load documents and use cursor rules files.  
4. **[AI Assistant Notebook](https://github.com/billk-FM/ras-commander/blob/main/ai_tools/rascommander_code_assistant.ipynb)**: A notebook for dynamic code summarization and API interaction (bring your own API Key).  Currently, this only does a single-shot message on the Claude Sonnet 3.5 API, which can be up to 50 cents per request.  Future revisions will include the ability to select which knowledge base file to include, a choice of SOTA models + multi turn conversations to build automation notebooks interactively.  

These tools aim to streamline development and provide intelligent assistance when modeling with, and working with and revising the ras-commander library.

## Installation

Create a virtual environment with conda or venv (ask ChatGPT if you need help)

In your virtual environment, install ras-commander using pip:
```
pip install h5py numpy pandas requests tqdm scipy
pip install ras-commander
```

If you have dependency issues with pip (especially if you have errors with numpy), try clearing your local pip packages 'C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Roaming\Python\' and then creating a new virtual environment.  
   

## Requirements

## Accessing HEC Examples through RasExamples

The `RasExamples` class provides functionality for quickly loading and managing HEC-RAS example projects. This is particularly useful for testing and development purposes.

Key features:
- Download and extract HEC-RAS example projects
- List available project categories and projects
- Extract specific projects for use
- Manage example project data efficiently

Example usage:
from ras_commander import RasExamples

```
ras_examples = RasExamples()
ras_examples.get_example_projects()  # Downloads example projects if not already present
categories = ras_examples.list_categories()
projects = ras_examples.list_projects("Steady Flow")
extracted_paths = ras_examples.extract_project(["Bald Eagle Creek", "Muncie"])
```

## RasPrj

The `RasPrj` class is central to managing HEC-RAS projects within the ras-commander library. It handles project initialization, data loading, and provides access to project components.

Key features:
- Initialize HEC-RAS projects
- Load and manage project data (plans, geometries, flows, etc.)
- Provide easy access to project files and information

Note: While a global `ras` object is available for convenience, you can create multiple `RasPrj` instances to manage several projects simultaneously.

Example usage:
```
from ras_commander import RasPrj, init_ras_project
```

### Using the global ras object
```
init_ras_project("/path/to/project", "6.5")
```

### Creating a custom RasPrj instance
```
custom_project = RasPrj()
init_ras_project("/path/to/another_project", "6.5", ras_instance=custom_project)
```

## RasHdf

The `RasHdf` class provides utilities for working with HDF files in HEC-RAS projects, enabling easy access to simulation results and model data.

Example usage:

```python
from ras_commander import RasHdf, init_ras_project, RasPrj

# Initialize project with a custom ras object
custom_ras = RasPrj()
init_ras_project("/path/to/project", "6.5", ras_instance=custom_ras)

# Get runtime data for a specific plan
plan_number = "01"
runtime_data = RasHdf.get_runtime_data(plan_number, ras_object=custom_ras)
print(runtime_data)
```

This class simplifies the process of extracting and analyzing data from HEC-RAS HDF output files, supporting tasks such as post-processing and result visualization.

## 1. Naming Conventions

### 1.1 General Rules
- Use `snake_case` for all function and variable names
- Use `PascalCase` for class names
- Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants

### 1.2 Library-Specific Naming
- Informal Name: RAS Commander
- Package Name and GitHub Library Name: ras-commander (with a hyphen)
- Import Name: ras_commander (with an underscore)
- Main Class of functions for HEC-RAS Automation: RasCmdr

### 1.3 Function Naming
- Start function names with a verb describing the action
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Common verbs and their uses:
  - `get_`: retrieve data
  - `set_`: set values or properties
  - `compute_`: execute or calculate
  - `clone_`: copy
  - `clear_`: remove or reset data
  - `find_`: search
  - `update_`: modify existing data

### 1.4 Abbreviations
Use the following abbreviations consistently throughout the codebase:

- ras: HEC-RAS
- prj: Project
- geom: Geometry
- pre: Preprocessor
- geompre: Geometry Preprocessor
- num: Number
- init: Initialize
- XS: Cross Section
- DSS: Data Storage System
- GIS: Geographic Information System
- BC: Boundary Condition
- IC: Initial Condition
- TW: Tailwater

Use these abbreviations in lowercase for function and variable names (e.g., `geom`, not `Geom` or `GEOM`).

### 1.5 Class Naming
- Use `PascalCase` for class names (e.g., `FileOperations`, `PlanOperations`, `RasCmdr`)
- Class names should be nouns or noun phrases

### 1.6 Variable Naming
- Use descriptive names indicating purpose or content
- Prefix boolean variables with `is_`, `has_`, or similar

## 2. Code Structure and Organization

### 2.1 File Organization
- Group related functions into appropriate classes
- Keep each class in its own file, named after the class

### 2.2 Function Organization
- Order functions logically within a class
- Place common or important functions at the top of the class

### 2.3 Module Structure
- Use the following order for module contents:
  1. Module-level docstring
  2. Imports (grouped and ordered)
  3. Constants
  4. Classes
  5. Functions

## 3. Documentation and Comments

### 3.1 Docstrings
- Use docstrings for all modules, classes, methods, and functions
- Follow Google Python Style Guide format
- Include parameters, return values, and a brief description
- For complex functions, include examples in the docstring

### 3.2 Comments
- Use inline comments sparingly, only for complex logic
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Use TODO comments for future work, formatted as: `# TODO: description`

## 4. Code Style

### 4.1 Imports
- Order imports as follows:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Third-party library imports
  3. Local application imports
- Use absolute imports
- Use `import ras_commander as ras` for shortening the library name in examples

### 4.2 Whitespace
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code

### 4.3 Line Length
- Limit lines to 79 characters for code, 72 for comments and docstrings
- Use parentheses for line continuation in long expressions

## 5. Error Handling

**Use Logging Instead of Prints**
Ensure that every operation that can fail or needs to provide feedback to the user is logged instead of using `print`. This will help in debugging and improve monitoring during execution.

   ```python
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
   ```

   Example of replacing a `print` with logging:
   ```python
   logging.info('Starting HEC-RAS simulation...')
   ```

- Use explicit exception handling with try/except blocks
- Raise custom exceptions when appropriate, with descriptive messages
- Use logging for error reporting and debugging information
- Use specific exception types when raising errors (e.g., `ValueError`, `FileNotFoundError`)
- Provide informative error messages that include relevant details
- Implement proper cleanup in finally blocks when necessary
- For user-facing functions, consider wrapping internal exceptions in custom exceptions specific to ras-commander

Example:
```python
try:
    result = compute_plan(plan_number)
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    raise RasCommanderError(f"Plan file not found: {e}")
except ValueError as e:
    raise RasCommanderError(f"Invalid plan parameter: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    raise RasCommanderError(f"Unexpected error during plan computation: {e}")
```

## 6. Testing

- Write unit tests for all functions and methods
- Use the `unittest` framework
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical functionality
- Include tests for both single-project and multi-project scenarios
- Write clear and descriptive test names
- Use setUp and tearDown methods for common test preparations and cleanups
- Use mock objects when appropriate to isolate units under test

## 7. Version Control

- Use meaningful commit messages that clearly describe the changes made
- Create feature branches for new features or significant changes
- Submit pull requests for code review before merging into the main branch
- Keep commits focused and atomic (one logical change per commit)
- Use git tags for marking releases
- Follow semantic versioning for release numbering

## 8. Type Hinting

- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use the `typing` module for complex types (e.g., `List`, `Dict`, `Optional`)
- Include type hints in function signatures and docstrings
- Use `Union` for parameters that can accept multiple types
- For methods that don't return a value, use `-> None`

Example:
```python
from typing import List, Optional

def process_plans(plan_numbers: List[str], max_workers: Optional[int] = None) -> bool:
    # Function implementation
    return True
```

## 9. Project-Specific Conventions

### 9.1 RAS Instance Handling
- Design functions to accept an optional `ras_object` parameter:
  ```python
  def some_function(param1, param2, ras_object=None):
      ras_obj = ras_object or ras
      ras_obj.check_initialized()
      # Function implementation
  ```

### 9.2 File Path Handling
- Use `pathlib.Path` for file and directory path manipulations
- Convert string paths to Path objects at the beginning of functions

### 9.3 DataFrame Handling
- Use pandas for data manipulation and storage where appropriate
- Prefer method chaining for pandas operations to improve readability

### 9.4 Parallel Execution
- Follow the guidelines in the "Benchmarking is All You Need" blog post for optimal core usage in parallel plan execution

### 9.5 Function Return Values
- Prefer returning meaningful values over modifying global state
- Use tuple returns for multiple values instead of modifying input parameters

## 10. Inheritance

### 10.1 General Principles

- Prioritize composition over inheritance when appropriate
- Design base classes for extension
- Clearly document the public API and subclass API using docstrings

### 10.2 Naming Conventions

- Public API: No leading underscores
- Subclass API: Single leading underscore (e.g., `_prepare_for_execution`)
- Internal attributes and methods: Single leading underscore
- Name mangling (double leading underscores): Use sparingly and document the decision clearly

### 10.3 Template Method Pattern

Consider using the template method pattern in base classes to define a high-level algorithm structure. Subclasses can then override specific steps to customize behavior.

### 10.4 Dataframe Access Control

Use properties to control access and modification of dataframes, providing a controlled interface for subclasses.

## 11. RasUtils Usage

- Use RasUtils for general-purpose utility functions that don't fit into other specific classes
- When adding new utility functions, ensure they are static methods of the RasUtils class
- Keep utility functions focused and single-purpose
- Document utility functions thoroughly, including examples of usage

Example:
```python
class RasUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def create_backup(file_path: Path, backup_suffix: str = "_backup") -> Path:
        """
        Create a backup of the specified file.

        Args:
            file_path (Path): Path to the file to be backed up
            backup_suffix (str): Suffix to append to the backup file name

        Returns:
            Path: Path to the created backup file

        Example:
            >>> backup_path = RasUtils.create_backup(Path("project.prj"))
            >>> print(f"Backup created at: {backup_path}")
        """
        # Function implementation
```

## 12. Working with RasExamples

- Use RasExamples for managing and loading example HEC-RAS projects
- Always check if example projects are already downloaded before attempting to download them again
- Use the `list_categories()` and `list_projects()` methods to explore available examples
- When extracting projects, use meaningful names and keep track of extracted paths
- Clean up extracted projects when they are no longer needed using `clean_projects_directory()`

Example:
```python
ras_examples = RasExamples()
if not ras_examples.is_project_extracted("Bald Eagle Creek"):
    extracted_path = ras_examples.extract_project("Bald Eagle Creek")[0]
    # Use the extracted project
    # ...
    # Clean up when done
    RasUtils.remove_with_retry(extracted_path, is_folder=True)
```

Remember, consistency is key. When in doubt, prioritize readability and clarity in your code. Always consider the maintainability and extensibility of the codebase when making design decisions.


13. Logging

Instructions for setting up a minimal logging decorator and applying it to functions:

1. Create logging_config.py:
```python
import logging
import functools

def setup_logging(level=logging.INFO):
    logging.basicConfig(level=level, format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def log_call(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        logger = logging.getLogger(func.__module__)
        logger.info(f"Calling {func.__name__}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

setup_logging()
```

2. In each module file (e.g., RasPrj.py, RasPlan.py):
   - Add at the top: `from ras_commander.logging_config import log_call`
   - Remove all existing logging configurations and logger instantiations

3. Apply the decorator to functions:
   - Replace existing logging statements with the `@log_call` decorator
   - Remove any manual logging within the function body

Example changes to functions:

Before:
```python
def compute_plan(plan_number, dest_folder=None, ras_object=None, clear_geompre=False, num_cores=None):
    logging.info(f"Computing plan {plan_number}")
    # ... function logic ...
    logging.info(f"Plan {plan_number} computation complete")
    return result
```

After:
```python
@log_call
def compute_plan(plan_number, dest_folder=None, ras_object=None, clear_geompre=False, num_cores=None):
    # ... function logic ...
    return result
```

Apply this pattern across all functions in the library. This approach will significantly reduce the code footprint while maintaining basic logging functionality.

#### --- START OF SCRIPT --- ####

# RAS Commander Library Notes:
# 1. This example demonstrates both the default global 'ras' object and custom ras objects.
# 2. The global 'ras' object is suitable for simple scripts working with a single project.
# 3. Custom ras objects are recommended for complex scripts or when working with multiple projects.
# 4. The init_ras_project function initializes a project and sets up the ras object.
# 5. Each ras object contains comprehensive information about its project, including plan, geometry, flow files, and boundary conditions.

# Best Practices:
# 1. For simple scripts working with a single project, using the global 'ras' object is fine.
# 2. For complex scripts or when working with multiple projects, create and use separate ras objects.
# 3. Be consistent in your approach: don't mix global and non-global ras object usage in the same script.
# 4. Use descriptive names for custom ras objects to clearly identify different projects.

"""
This script demonstrates the process of initializing a HEC-RAS project and performing various operations on plans, geometries, and unsteady flows using the functions within the RasPlan Class.

Process Flow:
1. Project Initialization: Initialize a HEC-RAS project by specifying the project path and version.
2. Plan Cloning: Clone an existing plan, creating a new plan entry.
3. Geometry Cloning: Clone a geometry associated with the original plan, generating a new geometry entry.
4. Unsteady Flow Cloning: Clone an unsteady flow, creating a new unsteady flow entry.
5. Plan Configuration:
   a. Set the cloned geometry for the new plan.
   b. Set the cloned unsteady flow for the new plan.
   c. Update the number of cores to be used for the new plan.
   d. Configure geometry preprocessor options for the new plan.
6. Plan Computation: Compute the new plan and verify successful execution.
7. Results Verification: Check the HDF entries to confirm that results were written.

Additional operations that could be demonstrated:
8. Plan Modification: Update specific parameters in the plan file (e.g., simulation time, output intervals).
9. Geometry Editing: Modify cross-sections, manning's n values, or other geometry data.
10. Unsteady Flow Modification: Adjust boundary conditions or initial conditions.
11. Batch Operations: Perform operations on multiple plans simultaneously.
12. Error Handling: Demonstrate how to handle and report errors during plan operations.
13. Results Analysis: Extract and analyze key output values from the computed plan.

# 3. Once you start using non-global ras objects, stick with that approach throughout your script.

#    - clear_geompre: Boolean to clear geometry preprocessor files before computation

# ras-commander Library Notes:
# 1. This example uses separate RasPrj objects for each project/folder.
# 2. Using separate RasPrj objects allows working with multiple projects or folders.
# 3. We'll create new RasPrj objects for the original project and each output folder.
# 4. For functions that do batched execution (sequential or parallel), they are careful not to overwrite existing folders.
# 5. If you want your script to be repeatable, make sure to delete the folders before running again.

# Best Practices:
# 1. For complex scripts or when working with multiple projects/folders, create and use separate RasPrj objects.
# 2. Be consistent in your approach: use non-global RasPrj objects throughout the script.
# 3. When using parallel execution, consider the number of cores available on your machine.
# 4. Use the dest_folder argument to keep your project folder clean and organized.

"""
RasCmdr - Execution operations for running HEC-RAS simulations

This module is part of the ras-commander library and uses a centralized logging configuration.

Logging Configuration:
- The logging is set up in the logging_config.py file.
- A @log_call decorator is available to automatically log function calls.
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Logs are written to both console and a rotating file handler.
- The default log file is 'ras_commander.log' in the 'logs' directory.
- The default log level is INFO.

To use logging in this module:
1. Use the @log_call decorator for automatic function call logging.
2. For additional logging, use logger.[level]() calls (e.g., logger.info(), logger.debug()).

Example:
    @log_call
    def my_function():
        
        logger.debug("Additional debug information")
        # Function logic here

# Module code starts here

# TODO: Future Enhancements
# 1. Alternate Run Mode for compute_plan and compute_parallel:
#    - Use Powershell to execute HEC-RAS command
#    - Hide RAS window and all child windows
#    - Note: This mode may prevent execution if the plan has a popup
#    - Intended for background runs or popup-free scenarios
#    - Limit to non-commercial use
#
# 2. Implement compute_plan_remote:
#    - Execute compute_plan on a remote machine via psexec
#    - Use keyring package for secure credential storage
#    - Implement psexec command for remote HEC-RAS execution
#    - Create remote_worker objects to store machine details:
#      (machine name, username, password, ras_exe_path, local folder path, etc.)
#    - Develop RasRemote class for remote_worker management and abstractions
#    - Implement compute_plan_remote in RasCmdr as a thin wrapper around RasRemote
#      (similar to existing compute_plan functions but for remote execution)

        Execute HEC-RAS plans in test mode. This is a re-creation of the HEC-RAS command line -test flag, 
        which does not work in recent versions of HEC-RAS.
        
        As a special-purpose function that emulates the original -test flag, it operates differently than the 
        other two compute_ functions. Per the original HEC-RAS test flag, it creates a separate test folder,
        copies the project there, and executes the specified plans in sequential order.
        
        For most purposes, just copying a the project folder, initing that new folder, then running each plan 
        with compute_plan is a simpler and more flexible approach.  This is shown in the examples provided
        in the ras-commander library.

        Args:
            plan_number (str, list[str], optional): Plan number or list of plan numbers to execute. 
                If None, all plans will be executed. Default is None.
            dest_folder_suffix (str, optional): Suffix to append to the test folder name to create dest_folder. 
                Defaults to "[Test]".
                dest_folder is always created in the project folder's parent directory.
            clear_geompre (bool, optional): Whether to clear geometry preprocessor files.
                Defaults to False.
            num_cores (int, optional): Maximum number of cores to use for each plan.
                If None, the current setting is not changed. Default is None.
            ras_object (RasPrj, optional): Specific RAS object to use. If None, uses the global ras instance.
            overwrite_dest (bool, optional): If True, overwrite the destination folder if it exists. Defaults to False.

        Returns:
            Dict[str, bool]: Dictionary of plan numbers and their execution success status.

        Example:
            Run all plans: RasCommander.compute_test_mode()
            Run a specific plan: RasCommander.compute_test_mode(plan_number="01")
            Run multiple plans: RasCommander.compute_test_mode(plan_number=["01", "03", "05"])
            Run plans with a custom folder suffix: RasCommander.compute_test_mode(dest_folder_suffix="[TestRun]")
            Run plans and clear geometry preprocessor files: RasCommander.compute_test_mode(clear_geompre=True)
            Run plans with a specific number of cores: RasCommander.compute_test_mode(num_cores=4)
            
        Notes:
            - This function executes plans in a separate folder for isolated testing.
            - If plan_number is not provided, all plans in the project will be executed.
            - The function does not change the geometry preprocessor and IB tables settings.  
                - To force recomputing of geometry preprocessor and IB tables, use the clear_geompre=True option.
            - Plans are executed sequentially.
            - Because copying the project is implicit, only a dest_folder_suffix option is provided.
            - For more flexible run management, use the compute_parallel or compute_sequential functions.

"""
RasExamples - Manage and load HEC-RAS example projects for testing and development

This module is part of the ras-commander library and uses a centralized logging configuration.

Logging Configuration:
- The logging is set up in the logging_config.py file.
- A @log_call decorator is available to automatically log function calls.
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Logs are written to both console and a rotating file handler.
- The default log file is 'ras_commander.log' in the 'logs' directory.
- The default log level is INFO.

To use logging in this module:
1. Use the @log_call decorator for automatic function call logging.
2. For additional logging, use logger.[level]() calls (e.g., logger.info(), logger.debug()).
3. Obtain the logger using: logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

Example:
    @log_call
    def my_function():
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        logger.debug("Additional debug information")
        # Function logic here

### How to Use the Revised `RasExamples` Class

1. **Instantiate the Class:**
   ```python
   ras_examples = RasExamples()
   ```

2. **Download FEMA BLE Models:**
   - Ensure you have the required CSV files by visiting [FEMA's Estimated Base Flood Elevation (BFE) Viewer](https://webapps.usgs.gov/infrm/estBFE/) and using the "Download as Table" option for each BLE model you wish to access.
   - Call the `download_fema_ble_models` method with the appropriate paths:
     ```python
     ras_examples.download_fema_ble_models('/path/to/csv/files', '/path/to/output/folder')
     ```
     - Replace `'/path/to/csv/files'` with the directory containing your CSV files.
     - Replace `'/path/to/output/folder'` with the directory where you want the BLE models to be downloaded and organized.

3. **Extract Projects (If Needed):**
   - After downloading, you can extract specific projects using the existing `extract_project` method:
     ```python
     extracted_paths = ras_examples.extract_project(["Bald Eagle Creek", "BaldEagleCrkMulti2D", "Muncie"])
     for path in extracted_paths:
         logging.info(f"Extracted to: {path}")
     ```

4. **Explore Projects and Categories:**
   - List available categories:
     ```python
     categories = ras_examples.list_categories()
     ```
   - List projects within a specific category:
     ```python
     projects = ras_examples.list_projects(category='SomeCategory')
     ```

5. **Clean Projects Directory (If Needed):**
   - To remove all extracted projects:
     ```python
     ras_examples.clean_projects_directory()
     ```

### Dependencies

Ensure that the following Python packages are installed:

- `pandas`
- `requests`

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas requests
```

### Notes

- The class uses Python's `logging` module to provide detailed information about its operations. Ensure that the logging level is set appropriately to capture the desired amount of detail.
- The `download_fema_ble_models` method handles large file downloads by streaming data in chunks, which is memory-efficient.
- All folder names are sanitized to prevent filesystem errors due to unsafe characters.

RasGeo - Operations for handling geometry files in HEC-RAS projects

This module is part of the ras-commander library and uses a centralized logging configuration.

Logging Configuration:
- The logging is set up in the logging_config.py file.
- A @log_call decorator is available to automatically log function calls.
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Logs are written to both console and a rotating file handler.
- The default log file is 'ras_commander.log' in the 'logs' directory.
- The default log level is INFO.

To use logging in this module:
1. Use the @log_call decorator for automatic function call logging.
2. For additional logging, use logger.[level]() calls (e.g., logger.info(), logger.debug()).
3. Obtain the logger using: logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

Example:
    @log_call
    def my_function():
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        logger.debug("Additional debug information")
        # Function logic here

RasHdf Module

This module provides utilities for working with RESULTS (Plan) HDF files in HEC-RAS projects.
It contains the RasHdf class, which offers various static methods for extracting,
analyzing, and manipulating data from HEC-RAS RESULTS HDF files.

Note:
    This method is decorated with @hdf_operation, which handles the opening and closing of the HDF file.
    The decorator should be used for all methods that directly interact with HDF files.
    It ensures proper file handling and error management.

    When using the @hdf_operation decorator:
    - The method receives an open h5py.File object as its first argument after 'cls'.
    - Error handling for file operations is managed by the decorator.
    - The HDF file is automatically closed after the method execution.

    Methods without this decorator must manually handle file opening, closing, and error management.
    Failure to use the decorator or properly manage the file can lead to resource leaks or file access errors.

Example:
    @classmethod
    @hdf_operation
    def example_method(cls, hdf_file: h5py.File, other_args):
        # Method implementation using hdf_file
        
This module is part of the ras-commander library and uses a centralized logging configuration.

Logging Configuration:
- The logging is set up in the logging_config.py file.
- A @log_call decorator is available to automatically log function calls.
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Logs are written to both console and a rotating file handler.
- The default log file is 'ras_commander.log' in the 'logs' directory.
- The default log level is INFO.

To use logging in this module:
1. Use the @log_call decorator for automatic function call logging.
2. For additional logging, use logger.[level]() calls (e.g., logger.info(), logger.debug()).
3. Obtain the logger using: logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

Example:
    @log_call
    def my_function():
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        logger.debug("Additional debug information")
        # Function logic here

"""
RasPlan - Operations for handling plan files in HEC-RAS projects

This module is part of the ras-commander library and uses a centralized logging configuration.

Logging Configuration:
- The logging is set up in the logging_config.py file.
- A @log_call decorator is available to automatically log function calls.
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Logs are written to both console and a rotating file handler.
- The default log file is 'ras_commander.log' in the 'logs' directory.
- The default log level is INFO.

To use logging in this module:
1. Use the @log_call decorator for automatic function call logging.
2. For additional logging, use logger.[level]() calls (e.g., logger.info(), logger.debug()).
3. Obtain the logger using: logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

Example:
    @log_call
    def my_function():
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        logger.debug("Additional debug information")
        # Function logic here

"""
RasPrj.py - Manages HEC-RAS projects within the ras-commander library

This module provides a class for managing HEC-RAS projects.

Classes:
    RasPrj: A class for managing HEC-RAS projects.

Functions:
    init_ras_project: Initialize a RAS project.
    get_ras_exe: Determine the HEC-RAS executable path based on the input.

DEVELOPER NOTE:
This class is used to initialize a RAS project and is used in conjunction with the RasCmdr class to manage the execution of RAS plans.
By default, the RasPrj class is initialized with the global 'ras' object.
However, you can create multiple RasPrj instances to manage multiple projects.
Do not mix and match global 'ras' object instances and custom instances of RasPrj - it will cause errors.

This module is part of the ras-commander library and uses a centralized logging configuration.

Logging Configuration:
- The logging is set up in the logging_config.py file.
- A @log_call decorator is available to automatically log function calls.
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Logs are written to both console and a rotating file handler.
- The default log file is 'ras_commander.log' in the 'logs' directory.
- The default log level is INFO.

To use logging in this module:
1. Use the @log_call decorator for automatic function call logging.
2. For additional logging, use logger.[level]() calls (e.g., logger.info(), logger.debug()).


Example:
    @log_call
    def my_function():
        
        logger.debug("Additional debug information")
        # Function logic here

        Extract boundary conditions from unsteady flow files and create a DataFrame.

        This method parses unsteady flow files to extract boundary condition information.
        It creates a DataFrame with structured data for known boundary condition types
        and parameters, and associates this information with the corresponding unsteady flow file.

        Note:
        Any lines in the boundary condition blocks that are not explicitly parsed and
        incorporated into the DataFrame are captured in a multi-line string. This string
        is logged at the DEBUG level for each boundary condition. This feature is crucial
        for developers incorporating new boundary condition types or parameters, as it
        allows them to see what information might be missing from the current parsing logic.
        If no unsteady flow files are present, it returns an empty DataFrame.

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing detailed boundary condition information,

    Initialize a RAS project.

    USE THIS FUNCTION TO INITIALIZE A RAS PROJECT, NOT THE INITIALIZE METHOD OF THE RasPrj CLASS.
    The initialize method of the RasPrj class only modifies the global 'ras' object.

    This function creates or initializes a RasPrj instance, providing a safer and more
    flexible interface than directly using the 'initialize' method.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    ras_project_folder : str
        The path to the RAS project folder.
    ras_version : str, optional
        The version of RAS to use (e.g., "6.5").
        The version can also be a full path to the Ras.exe file. (Useful when calling ras objects for folder copies.)
        If None, the function will attempt to use the version from the global 'ras' object or a default path.
        You MUST specify a version number via init at some point or ras will not run.  
        Once the ras_version is specified once it should auto-fill from the global 'ras' object.
        The RAS Commander Library Assistant can ignore this argument since it does not have Ras.exe present, but all of other operations are fully working.
    ras_instance : RasPrj, optional
        An instance of RasPrj to initialize. If None, the global 'ras' instance is used.

    Returns:
    --------
    RasPrj
        An initialized RasPrj instance.

    Usage:
    ------
    1. For general use with a single project:
        init_ras_project("/path/to/project")
        # Use the global 'ras' object after initialization

    2. For managing multiple projects:
        project1 = init_ras_project("/path/to/project1", "6.5", ras_instance=RasPrj())
        project2 = init_ras_project("/path/to/project2", ras_instance=RasPrj())

    Notes:
    ------
    - This function is preferred over directly calling the 'initialize' method.
    - It supports both the global 'ras' object and custom instances.
    - Be consistent in your approach: stick to either the global 'ras' object
      or custom instances throughout your script or application.
    - Document your choice of approach clearly in your code.
    - If ras_version is not provided, the function will attempt to use the version
      from the global 'ras' object or a default path.

    Warnings:
    ---------
    Avoid mixing use of the global 'ras' object and custom instances to prevent
    confusion and potential bugs.

"""
RasUnsteady - Operations for handling unsteady flow files in HEC-RAS projects.

This module is part of the ras-commander library and uses a centralized logging configuration.

Logging Configuration:
- The logging is set up in the logging_config.py file.
- A @log_call decorator is available to automatically log function calls.
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Logs are written to both console and a rotating file handler.
- The default log file is 'ras_commander.log' in the 'logs' directory.
- The default log level is INFO.

To use logging in this module:
1. Use the @log_call decorator for automatic function call logging.
2. For additional logging, use logger.[level]() calls (e.g., logger.info(), logger.debug()).


Example:
    @log_call
    def my_function():
        logger.debug("Additional debug information")

RasUtils - Utility functions for the ras-commander library

This module is part of the ras-commander library and uses a centralized logging configuration.

Logging Configuration:
- The logging is set up in the logging_config.py file.
- A @log_call decorator is available to automatically log function calls.
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Logs are written to both console and a rotating file handler.
- The default log file is 'ras_commander.log' in the 'logs' directory.
- The default log level is INFO.

To use logging in this module:
1. Use the @log_call decorator for automatic function call logging.
2. For additional logging, use logger.[level]() calls (e.g., logger.info(), logger.debug()).

Example:
    @log_call
    def my_function():
        logger.debug("Additional debug information")
        # Function logic here
