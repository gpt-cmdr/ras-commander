# RAS Commander Library Notes:
# 1. This example demonstrates both the default global 'ras' object and custom ras objects.
# 2. The global 'ras' object is suitable for simple scripts working with a single project.
# 3. Custom ras objects are recommended for complex scripts or when working with multiple projects.
# 4. The init_ras_project function initializes a project and sets up the ras object.
# 5. Each ras object contains comprehensive information about its project, including plan, geometry, flow files, and boundary conditions.

# Best Practices:
# 1. For simple scripts working with a single project, using the global 'ras' object is fine.
# 2. For complex scripts or when working with multiple projects, create and use separate ras objects.
# 3. Be consistent in your approach: don't mix global and non-global ras object usage in the same script.
# 4. Use descriptive names for custom ras objects to clearly identify different projects.

This script demonstrates the process of initializing a HEC-RAS project and performing various operations on plans, geometries, and unsteady flows using the functions within the RasPlan Class.

Process Flow:
1. Project Initialization: Initialize a HEC-RAS project by specifying the project path and version.
2. Plan Cloning: Clone an existing plan, creating a new plan entry.
3. Geometry Cloning: Clone a geometry associated with the original plan, generating a new geometry entry.
4. Unsteady Flow Cloning: Clone an unsteady flow, creating a new unsteady flow entry.
5. Plan Configuration:
   a. Set the cloned geometry for the new plan.
   b. Set the cloned unsteady flow for the new plan.
   c. Update the number of cores to be used for the new plan.
   d. Configure geometry preprocessor options for the new plan.
6. Update Simulation Parameters: Modify various simulation parameters in the new plan.
7. Plan Computation: Compute the new plan and verify successful execution.
8. Results Verification: Check the HDF entries to confirm that results were written.

#### --- START OF SCRIPT --- ####

# ras-commander Library Notes:
# 1. This example uses separate RasPrj objects for each project/folder.
# 2. Using separate RasPrj objects allows working with multiple projects or folders.
# 3. We'll create new RasPrj objects for the original project and each output folder.
# 4. For functions that do batched execution (sequential or parallel), they are careful not to overwrite existing folders.
# 5. If you want your script to be repeatable, make sure to delete the folders before running again.

# Best Practices:
# 1. For complex scripts or when working with multiple projects/folders, create and use separate RasPrj objects.
# 2. Be consistent in your approach: use non-global RasPrj objects throughout the script.
# 3. When using parallel execution, consider the number of cores available on your machine.
# 4. Use the dest_folder argument to keep your project folder clean and organized.
