## Coding Assistance Rules:

Your role is building, refactoring and debugging Python scripts using Python 3.9+, focusing on automation tasks for HEC-RAS projects.

1. Prefer default libraries where possible, especially pathlib for file operations.
2. Use r-strings for file and directory path inputs.
3. Use f-strings for string formatting and concatenation.
4. Always use pathlib over os for manipulation of file and directory paths.
5. Print DataFrame names and variable names before displaying DataFrames.
6. Prefer pandas for data manipulation and analysis tasks.
7. Use matplotlib or bokeh for visualization when needed.
8. Always include comments for code readability and explain complex operations.
9. Use logging for informative output and debugging information.
10. Follow PEP 8 conventions for code style.
11. Provide clear error handling and user feedback.
12. When using RAS Commander functions, explain their purpose and key arguments.
13. Encourage consistent use of either global 'ras' object or custom instances throughout scripts.
14. Highlight best practices for parallel execution and performance optimization.
15. Suggest using RasExamples for testing and learning purposes when appropriate.

When revising code, write planning steps as comments before implementation, labeled as:
## Explicit Planning and Reasoning for Revisions

For geodataframes, use the 'union_all()' method instead of the deprecated 'unary_union' attribute.

Note for pandas >= 2.0: Use pd.concat instead of the removed append method.

Always provide full code segments with no elides.

---

## Best Practices

### 1. RAS Object Usage

- **Single Project Scripts**:
  - Use the global `ras` object for simplicity.
    ```python
    from ras_commander import ras, init_ras_project

    init_ras_project("/path/to/project", "6.5")
    # Use ras object for operations
    ```

- **Multiple Projects**:
  - Create separate `RasPrj` instances for each project.
    ```python
    from ras_commander import RasPrj, init_ras_project

    project1 = init_ras_project("/path/to/project1", "6.5", ras_instance=RasPrj())
    project2 = init_ras_project("/path/to/project2", "6.5", ras_instance=RasPrj())
    ```

- **Consistency**:
  - Avoid mixing global and custom RAS objects in the same script.

### 2. Plan Specification

- Use plan numbers as strings (e.g., `"01"`, `"02"`) for consistency.
  ```python
  RasCmdr.compute_plan("01")
  ```

- Check available plans before specifying plan numbers.
  ```python
  print(ras.plan_df)  # Displays available plans
  ```

### 3. Geometry Preprocessor Files

- Clear geometry preprocessor files before significant changes.
  ```python
  RasGeo.clear_geompre_files()
  ```

- Use `clear_geompre=True` for a clean computation environment.
  ```python
  RasCmdr.compute_plan("01", clear_geompre=True)
  ```

### 4. Parallel Execution

- Adjust `max_workers` and `num_cores` based on system capabilities.
  ```python
  RasCmdr.compute_parallel(max_workers=4, num_cores=2)
  ```

- Use `dest_folder` to organize outputs and prevent conflicts.
  ```python
  RasCmdr.compute_parallel(dest_folder="/path/to/results")
  ```

### 5. Error Handling

- Implement try-except blocks to handle potential errors.
  ```python
  try:
      RasCmdr.compute_plan("01")
  except FileNotFoundError:
      print("Plan file not found")
  ```

- Utilize logging for informative output.
  ```python
  import logging
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
  ```

### 6. File Path Handling

- Use `pathlib.Path` for robust file and directory operations.
  ```python
  from pathlib import Path
  project_path = Path("/path/to/project")
  ```

### 7. Type Hinting

- Apply type hints to improve code readability and IDE support.
  ```python
  def compute_plan(plan_number: str, clear_geompre: bool = False) -> bool:
      ...
  ```

---

## Usage Patterns

### Initializing a Project

```python
from ras_commander import init_ras_project, ras

init_ras_project("/path/to/project", "6.5")
print(f"Working with project: {ras.project_name}")
```

### Cloning a Plan

```python
from ras_commander import RasPlan

new_plan_number = RasPlan.clone_plan("01")
print(f"Created new plan: {new_plan_number}")
```

### Executing Plans

- **Single Plan Execution**:
  ```python
  from ras_commander import RasCmdr

  success = RasCmdr.compute_plan("01", num_cores=2)
  print(f"Plan execution {'successful' if success else 'failed'}")
  ```

- **Parallel Execution of Multiple Plans**:
  ```python
  from ras_commander import RasCmdr

  results = RasCmdr.compute_parallel(
      plan_numbers=["01", "02", "03"],
      max_workers=3,
      num_cores=4,
      dest_folder="/path/to/results",
      clear_geompre=True
  )

  for plan, success in results.items():
      print(f"Plan {plan}: {'Successful' if success else 'Failed'}")
  ```

### Working with Multiple Projects

```python
from ras_commander import RasPrj, init_ras_project, RasCmdr

# Initialize two separate projects
project1 = init_ras_project("/path/to/project1", "6.5", ras_instance=RasPrj())
project2 = init_ras_project("/path/to/project2", "6.5", ras_instance=RasPrj())

# Perform operations on each project
RasCmdr.compute_plan("01", ras_object=project1)
RasCmdr.compute_plan("02", ras_object=project2)

# Compare results
results1 = project1.get_hdf_entries()
results2 = project2.get_hdf_entries()
```

### Performance Optimization

```python
from ras_commander import RasCmdr

results = RasCmdr.compute_parallel(
    plan_numbers=["01", "02", "03"],
    max_workers=3,
    num_cores=4,
    dest_folder="/path/to/results",
    clear_geompre=True
)

for plan, success in results.items():
    print(f"Plan {plan}: {'Successful' if success else 'Failed'}")
```

- **Best Practices**:
  - Use `compute_parallel()` for concurrent plan execution.
  - Adjust `max_workers` and `num_cores` based on system capabilities.
  - Organize outputs with `dest_folder`.
  - Use `clear_geompre=True` for clean computations.

## Inclusion of .cursorrules and ai_tools for AI-driven Coding Experience

Open the ras_commander folder in the Cursor IDE, and it will automatically include the .cursorrules file in your instructions. Additionally, two other provided methods for interacting with the library through your current AI subscriptions:

- ChatGPT: ras_commander GPT Assistant (LINK HERE)
- Latest LLM summaries of the code base:
   - Entire code base: LINK HERE (TOKEN COUNT) (for Claude or Gemini)
   - Examples and Function Docstrings Only: LINK HERE (TOKEN COUNT) (for GPT-4o, o1 or Llama 3.1 405b)
- Cursor IDE through .cursorrules file
- 'rascommander_code_assistant.ipynb' notebook in the ras_commander folder, which allows for dynamic summarization of the code base and API chatting directly through the notebook.

There are a series of scripts provided in the "llm_summaries" folder that provide summaries of the code base, and the docstrings of the functions. They can be run in your local environment, or provided to ChatGPT's code interpreter for execution.

## RAS-Cmdr GPT Assistant

The RAS Commander GPT assistant has access to the entire code base, and can be a helpful tool for understanding the library and its capabilities.  However, it is subject to the same context window limitations and file retrieval limitations as I have covered in ADD BLOG LINK HERE.  For best results, use the llm summaries above to provide robust context to the model before asking to generate complex workflows. 

## Current Uses and Roadmap Items

### Potential Uses (Roadmap Items) of HEC-RAS Automation Functions

This set of functions provides a powerful foundation for automating various aspects of HEC-RAS modeling workflows. Here are some potential applications:

1. **Calibration and Sensitivity Analysis:**
    - **Automated Parameter Variation:** Users can create multiple simulation scenarios with varying parameters (e.g., Manning's n values, boundary conditions, initial conditions) to calibrate their model against observed data.
    - **Sensitivity Testing:** Evaluate the impact of different input parameters on model outputs by generating a range of scenarios and analyzing the results. This helps identify critical parameters that require more attention during calibration.

2. **Real-time Forecasting:**
    - **Dynamic Model Updates:** Integrate with external data sources (e.g., weather forecasts, streamflow observations) to automatically update boundary conditions and initial conditions in unsteady flow files before running the simulation.
    - **Ensemble Forecasting:** Generate multiple forecasts by incorporating uncertainty in input data and model parameters. This provides a more comprehensive understanding of potential future flow conditions.

3. **Scenario Analysis:**
    - **Land Use Change Impacts:** Evaluate the effects of land use changes on flood risk by modifying Manning's n values using `extract_2d_mannings_tables`, `modify_2d_mannings_table`, and `write_2d_mannings_tables` and running simulations with updated geometry files.
    - **Climate Change Impacts:** Analyze the potential impacts of projected climate changes on flood risk by adjusting precipitation patterns and other relevant parameters in unsteady flow files.

4. **Batch Processing and High-Performance Computing:**
    - **Large-scale Model Runs:** Utilize `run_plans_parallel` to execute multiple simulations concurrently on a multi-core system, significantly reducing processing time for large-scale models or complex scenarios.
    - **Automated Report Generation:** Integrate with Python libraries like matplotlib and bokeh to automatically generate customized reports summarizing simulation results, including tables, figures, and maps.

5. **Model Development and Testing:**
    - **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly set up and run new model configurations using template files and automated workflows, facilitating rapid model development and testing.
    - **Regression Testing:** Ensure model integrity and consistency after code changes or updates by automatically running a predefined set of simulations and comparing results with expected outputs.

6. **User-Friendly Interfaces:**
    - **GUI Development:** Integrate with Python GUI libraries like Tkinter or PyQt to create user-friendly interfaces for automating HEC-RAS workflows, allowing non-programmers to access the power of automation.

## 1. Naming Conventions

### 1.1 General Rules
- Use `snake_case` for all function and variable names
- Use `PascalCase` for class names
- Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants

### 1.2 Library-Specific Naming
- Informal Name: RAS Commander
- Package Name and GitHub Library Name: ras-commander (with a hyphen)
- Import Name: ras_commander (with an underscore)
- Main Class of functions for HEC-RAS Automation: RasCmdr

### 1.3 Function Naming
- Start function names with a verb describing the action
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Common verbs and their uses:
  - `get_`: retrieve data
  - `set_`: set values or properties
  - `compute_`: execute or calculate
  - `clone_`: copy
  - `clear_`: remove or reset data
  - `find_`: search
  - `update_`: modify existing data

### 1.4 Abbreviations
Use the following abbreviations consistently throughout the codebase:

- ras: HEC-RAS
- prj: Project
- geom: Geometry
- pre: Preprocessor
- geompre: Geometry Preprocessor
- num: Number
- init: Initialize
- XS: Cross Section
- DSS: Data Storage System
- GIS: Geographic Information System
- BC: Boundary Condition
- IC: Initial Condition
- TW: Tailwater

Use these abbreviations in lowercase for function and variable names (e.g., `geom`, not `Geom` or `GEOM`).

### 1.5 Class Naming
- Use `PascalCase` for class names (e.g., `FileOperations`, `PlanOperations`, `RasCmdr`)
- Class names should be nouns or noun phrases

### 1.6 Variable Naming
- Use descriptive names indicating purpose or content
- Prefix boolean variables with `is_`, `has_`, or similar

## 2. Code Structure and Organization

### 2.1 File Organization
- Group related functions into appropriate classes
- Keep each class in its own file, named after the class

### 2.2 Function Organization
- Order functions logically within a class
- Place common or important functions at the top of the class

### 2.3 Module Structure
- Use the following order for module contents:
  1. Module-level docstring
  2. Imports (grouped and ordered)
  3. Constants
  4. Classes
  5. Functions

## 3. Documentation and Comments

### 3.1 Docstrings
- Use docstrings for all modules, classes, methods, and functions
- Follow Google Python Style Guide format
- Include parameters, return values, and a brief description
- For complex functions, include examples in the docstring

### 3.2 Comments
- Use inline comments sparingly, only for complex logic
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Use TODO comments for future work, formatted as: `# TODO: description`

## 4. Code Style

### 4.1 Imports
- Order imports as follows:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Third-party library imports
  3. Local application imports
- Use absolute imports
- Use `import ras_commander as ras` for shortening the library name in examples

### 4.2 Whitespace
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code

### 4.3 Line Length
- Limit lines to 79 characters for code, 72 for comments and docstrings
- Use parentheses for line continuation in long expressions

## 5. Error Handling

- Use explicit exception handling with try/except blocks
- Raise custom exceptions when appropriate, with descriptive messages
- Use logging for error reporting and debugging information
- Use specific exception types when raising errors (e.g., `ValueError`, `FileNotFoundError`)
- Provide informative error messages that include relevant details
- Implement proper cleanup in finally blocks when necessary
- For user-facing functions, consider wrapping internal exceptions in custom exceptions specific to ras-commander

Example:
```python
try:
    result = compute_plan(plan_number)
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    raise RasCommanderError(f"Plan file not found: {e}")
except ValueError as e:
    raise RasCommanderError(f"Invalid plan parameter: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    raise RasCommanderError(f"Unexpected error during plan computation: {e}")
```

## 6. Testing

- Write unit tests for all functions and methods
- Use the `unittest` framework
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical functionality
- Include tests for both single-project and multi-project scenarios
- Write clear and descriptive test names
- Use setUp and tearDown methods for common test preparations and cleanups
- Use mock objects when appropriate to isolate units under test

## 7. Version Control

- Use meaningful commit messages that clearly describe the changes made
- Create feature branches for new features or significant changes
- Submit pull requests for code review before merging into the main branch
- Keep commits focused and atomic (one logical change per commit)
- Use git tags for marking releases
- Follow semantic versioning for release numbering

## 8. Type Hinting

- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use the `typing` module for complex types (e.g., `List`, `Dict`, `Optional`)
- Include type hints in function signatures and docstrings
- Use `Union` for parameters that can accept multiple types
- For methods that don't return a value, use `-> None`

Example:
```python
from typing import List, Optional

def process_plans(plan_numbers: List[str], max_workers: Optional[int] = None) -> bool:
    # Function implementation
    return True
```

## 9. Project-Specific Conventions

### 9.1 RAS Instance Handling
- Design functions to accept an optional `ras_object` parameter:
  ```python
  def some_function(param1, param2, ras_object=None):
      ras_obj = ras_object or ras
      ras_obj.check_initialized()
      # Function implementation
  ```

### 9.2 File Path Handling
- Use `pathlib.Path` for file and directory path manipulations
- Convert string paths to Path objects at the beginning of functions

### 9.3 DataFrame Handling
- Use pandas for data manipulation and storage where appropriate
- Prefer method chaining for pandas operations to improve readability

### 9.4 Parallel Execution
- Follow the guidelines in the "Benchmarking is All You Need" blog post for optimal core usage in parallel plan execution

### 9.5 Function Return Values
- Prefer returning meaningful values over modifying global state
- Use tuple returns for multiple values instead of modifying input parameters

## 10. Inheritance

### 10.1 General Principles

- Prioritize composition over inheritance when appropriate
- Design base classes for extension
- Clearly document the public API and subclass API using docstrings

### 10.2 Naming Conventions

- Public API: No leading underscores
- Subclass API: Single leading underscore (e.g., `_prepare_for_execution`)
- Internal attributes and methods: Single leading underscore
- Name mangling (double leading underscores): Use sparingly and document the decision clearly

### 10.3 Template Method Pattern

Consider using the template method pattern in base classes to define a high-level algorithm structure. Subclasses can then override specific steps to customize behavior.

### 10.4 Dataframe Access Control

Use properties to control access and modification of dataframes, providing a controlled interface for subclasses.

## 11. RasUtils Usage

- Use RasUtils for general-purpose utility functions that don't fit into other specific classes
- When adding new utility functions, ensure they are static methods of the RasUtils class
- Keep utility functions focused and single-purpose
- Document utility functions thoroughly, including examples of usage

Example:
```python
class RasUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def create_backup(file_path: Path, backup_suffix: str = "_backup") -> Path:
        """
        Create a backup of the specified file.

        Args:
            file_path (Path): Path to the file to be backed up
            backup_suffix (str): Suffix to append to the backup file name

        Returns:
            Path: Path to the created backup file

        Example:
            >>> backup_path = RasUtils.create_backup(Path("project.prj"))
            >>> print(f"Backup created at: {backup_path}")
        """
        # Function implementation
```

## 12. Working with RasExamples

- Use RasExamples for managing and loading example HEC-RAS projects
- Always check if example projects are already downloaded before attempting to download them again
- Use the `list_categories()` and `list_projects()` methods to explore available examples
- When extracting projects, use meaningful names and keep track of extracted paths
- Clean up extracted projects when they are no longer needed using `clean_projects_directory()`

Example:
```python
ras_examples = RasExamples()
if not ras_examples.is_project_extracted("Bald Eagle Creek"):
    extracted_path = ras_examples.extract_project("Bald Eagle Creek")[0]
    # Use the extracted project
    # ...
    # Clean up when done
    RasUtils.remove_with_retry(extracted_path, is_folder=True)
```

Remember, consistency is key. When in doubt, prioritize readability and clarity in your code. Always consider the maintainability and extensibility of the codebase when making design decisions.

# 4. The init_ras_project function initializes a project and sets up the ras object.
# 5. Each ras object contains information about its project, including plan, geometry, and flow files.

# Best Practices:
# 1. For simple scripts working with a single project, using the global 'ras' object is fine.
# 2. For complex scripts or when working with multiple projects, create and use separate ras objects.
# 3. Be consistent in your approach: don't mix global and non-global ras object usage in the same script.
# 4. Use descriptive names for custom ras objects to clearly identify different projects.

# ras-commander Library Notes:
# 1. This example uses the default global 'ras' object for simplicity.
# 2. If you need to work with multiple projects, use separate ras objects for each project.
# 3. Once you start using non-global ras objects, stick with that approach throughout your script.
# 4. For functions that do batched execution (sequential or parallel), they are careful not to overwrite existing folders.
# 5. If you want your script to be repeatable, make sure to delete the folders before running again.

# Best Practices:
# 1. For simple scripts working with a single project, using the global 'ras' object is fine.
# 2. For complex scripts or when working with multiple projects, create and use separate ras objects.
# 3. Be consistent in your approach: don't mix global and non-global ras object usage in the same script.
# 4. When using parallel execution, consider the number of cores available on your machine.
# 5. Use the dest_folder argument to keep your project folder clean and organized.

# TO DO: 
# 1. Alternate Run Mode for compute_plan and compute_parallel:  Using Powershell to execute the HEC-RAS command and hide the RAS window and all child windows.
#    If this is implemented, and the plan has a popup, then the plan will not execute.  This is a deal breaker for many scenarios, and should only be used
#    as a special option for those who don't want to deal with the popups, or want to run in the background.  This option should be limited to non-commercial use.
# 2. Implment compute_plan_remote to go along with compute_plan.  This will be a compute_plan that is run on a remote machine via a psexec command.
#    First, we will use the keyring package to securely store the remote machine username and password.
#    Second, we will implement the psexec command to execute the HEC-RAS command on the remote machine.
#    Each machine will need to be initialized as a remote_worker object, which will store the machine name, username, password, ras_exe_path, local folder path and other relevant info.
#    A separate RasRemote class will be created to handle the creation of the remote_worker objects and the necessary abstractions. 
#    The compute_plan_remote function will live in RasCmdr, and will be a thin abstraction above the RasRemote class, since the functions will be simliar to the existing compute_plan functions, but specific to remote execution.

            ras_object (RasPrj, optional): Specific RAS object to use. If None, uses the global ras instance.
            dest_folder (str | Path, optional): Destination folder for the final computed results.
                If None, results will be stored in a "[Computed]" folder next to the original project.
            overwrite_dest (bool, optional): If True, overwrite the destination folder if it exists. Defaults to False.

        Returns:
            dict[str, bool]: A dictionary with plan numbers as keys and boolean values indicating success (True) or failure (False).

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the destination folder exists and is not empty, and overwrite_dest is False.
            FileNotFoundError: If a plan file is not found.

        Notes:
            - This function creates separate folders for each worker to ensure isolated execution.
            - Each worker uses its own RAS object to prevent conflicts.
            - Plans are distributed among workers using a queue to ensure efficient parallel processing.
            - The function automatically handles cleanup and consolidation of results after execution.
        
        Revision Notes:
            - Added support for clear_geompre flag as a pass-through to compute_plan.
            - Simplified worker thread logic by removing redundant operations.
            - Removed duplicate RAS object initialization in worker threads.

    A class for quickly loading HEC-RAS example projects for testing and development of ras-commander.

    This class provides functionality to download, extract, and manage HEC-RAS example projects.

    Attributes:
        base_url (str): Base URL for downloading HEC-RAS example projects.
        valid_versions (list): List of valid HEC-RAS versions for example projects.
        base_dir (Path): Base directory for storing example projects.

        csv_file_path (Path): Path to the CSV file for caching project metadata.

    
    Future Improvements:
    - Implement the ability for user-provided example projects (provided as a zip file) for their own repeatable examples. 
    - If the zip file is in the same folder structure as the HEC-RAS example projects, simple replace Example_Projects_6_5.zip and the folder structure will be automatically extracted from the zip file.
    - The actual RAS example projects haven't been updated much, but there is the structure here to handle future versions. Although this version of the code is probably fine for a few years, until HEC-RAS 2025 comes out.
