RAS Object Usage\\n\\n- **Single Project Scripts**:\\n  - Use the global `ras` object for simplicity.\\n    ```python\\n    from ras_commander import ras, init_ras_project\\n\\n    init_ras_project(\"/path/to/project\", \"6.5\")\\n    # Use ras object for operations\\n    ```\\n\\n- **Multiple Projects**:\\n  - Create separate `RasPrj` instances for each project.\\n    ```python\\n    from ras_commander import RasPrj, init_ras_project\\n\\n    project1 = init_ras_project(\"/path/to/project1\", \"6.5\", ras_instance=RasPrj())\\n    project2 = init_ras_project(\"/path/to/project2\", \"6.5\", ras_instance=RasPrj())\\n    ```\\n\\n- **Consistency**:\\n  - Avoid mixing global and custom RAS objects in the same script.\\n\\n### 2. Plan Specification\\n\\n- Use plan numbers as strings (e.g., `\"01\"`, `\"02\"`) for consistency.\\n  ```python\\n  RasCmdr.compute_plan(\"01\")\\n  ```\\n\\n- Check available plans before specifying plan numbers.\\n  ```python\\n  print(ras.plan_df)  # Displays available plans\\n  ```\\n\\n### 3. Geometry Preprocessor Files\\n\\n- Clear geometry preprocessor files before significant changes.\\n  ```python\\n  RasGeo.clear_geompre_files()\\n  ```\\n\\n- Use `clear_geompre=True` for a clean computation environment.\\n  ```python\\n  RasCmdr.compute_plan(\"01\", clear_geompre=True)\\n  ```\\n\\n### 4. Parallel Execution\\n\\n- Adjust `max_workers` and `num_cores` based on system capabilities.\\n  ```python\\n  RasCmdr.compute_parallel(max_workers=4, num_cores=2)\\n  ```\\n\\n- Use `dest_folder` to organize outputs and prevent conflicts.\\n  ```python\\n  RasCmdr.compute_parallel(dest_folder=\"/path/to/results\")\\n  ```\\n\\n### 5. Error Handling\\n\\n- Implement try-except blocks to handle potential errors.\\n  ```python\\n  try:\\n      RasCmdr.compute_plan(\"01\")\\n  except FileNotFoundError:\\n      print(\"Plan file not found\")\\n  ```\\n\\n- Utilize logging for informative output.\\n  ```python\\n  import logging\\n  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\\n  ```\\n\\n### 6. File Path Handling\\n\\n- Use `pathlib.Path` for robust file and directory operations.\\n  ```python\\n  from pathlib import Path\\n  project_path = Path(\"/path/to/project\")\\n  ```\\n\\n### 7. Type Hinting\\n\\n- Apply type hints to improve code readability and IDE support.\\n  ```python\\n  def compute_plan(plan_number: str, clear_geompre: bool = False) -> bool:\\n      ...\\n  ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Usage Patterns\\n\\n### Initializing a Project\\n```python\\nfrom ras_commander import init_ras_project, ras\\n\\ninit_ras_project(\"/path/to/project\", \"6.5\")\\nprint(f\"Working with project: {ras.project_name}\")\\n```\\n\\n### Cloning a Plan\\n\\n```python\\nfrom ras_commander import RasPlan\\n\\nnew_plan_number = RasPlan.clone_plan(\"01\")\\nprint(f\"Created new plan: {new_plan_number}\")\\n```\\n\\n### Executing Plans\\n\\n- **Single Plan Execution**:\\n  ```python\\n  from ras_commander import RasCmdr\\n\\n  success = RasCmdr.compute_plan(\"01\", num_cores=2)\\n  print(f\"Plan execution {\\'successful\\' if success else \\'failed\\'}\")\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Parallel Execution of Multiple Plans**:\\n  ```python\\n  from ras_commander import RasCmdr\\n\\n  results = RasCmdr.compute_parallel(\\n      plan_numbers=[\"01\", \"02\", \"03\"],\\n      max_workers=3,\\n      num_cores=4,\\n      dest_folder=\"/path/to/results\",\\n      clear_geompre=True\\n  )\\n\\n  for plan, success in results.items():\\n      print(f\"Plan {plan}: {\\'Successful\\' if success else \\'Failed\\'}\")\\n  ```\\n\\n### Working with Multiple Projects\\n\\n```python\\nfrom ras_commander import RasPrj, init_ras_project, RasCmdr\\n\\n# Initialize two separate projects\\nproject1 = init_ras_project(\"/path/to/project1\", \"6.5\", ras_instance=RasPrj())\\nproject2 = init_ras_project(\"/path/to/project2\", \"6.5\", ras_instance=RasPrj())\\n\\n# Perform operations on each project\\nRasCmdr.compute_plan(\"01\", ras_object=project1)\\nRasCmdr.compute_plan(\"02\", ras_object=project2)\\n\\n# Compare results\\nresults1 = project1.get_hdf_entries()\\nresults2 = project2.get_hdf_entries()\\n```\\n\\n### Performance Optimization\\n\\n```python\\nfrom ras_commander import RasCmdr\\n\\nresults = RasCmdr.compute_parallel(\\n    plan_numbers=[\"01\", \"02\", \"03\"],\\n    max_workers=3,\\n    num_cores=4,\\n    dest_folder=\"/path/to/results\",\\n    clear_geompre=True\\n)\\n\\nfor plan, success in results.items():\\n    print(f\"Plan {plan}: {\\'Successful\\' if success else \\'Failed\\'}\")\\n```\\n\\n- **Best Practices**:\\n  - Use `compute_parallel()` for concurrent plan execution.\\n  - Adjust `max_workers` and `num_cores` based on system capabilities.\\n  - Organize outputs with `dest_folder`.\\n  - Use `clear_geompre=True` for clean computations.\\n\\n### Working with Boundary Conditions\\n\\n```python\\nfrom ras_commander import init_ras_project\\n\\n# Initialize a project\\nproject = init_ras_project(\"/path/to/project\", \"6.5\")\\n\\n# Access boundary conditions\\nboundary_conditions = project.boundaries_df\\n\\n# Display boundary condition information\\nprint(boundary_conditions)\\n\\n# Filter boundary conditions for a specific river\\nriver_boundaries = boundary_conditions[boundary_conditions[\\'river_reach_name\\'] == \\'Main River\\']\\nprint(river_boundaries)\\n```\\n\\n### Using RasUtils Statistical Methods\\n\\n```python\\nfrom ras_commander import RasUtils\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\n# Example observed and predicted values\\nobserved = np.array([100, 120, 140, 160, 180])\\npredicted = np.array([105, 125, 135, 165, 175])\\n\\n# Calculate error metrics\\nmetrics = RasUtils.calculate_error_metrics(observed, predicted)\\n\\nprint(f\"Correlation: {metrics[\\'cor\\']:.4f}\")\\nprint(f\"RMSE: {metrics[\\'rmse\\']:.4f}\")\\nprint(f\"Percent Bias: {metrics[\\'pb\\']:.4f}\")\\n\\n# Calculate individual metrics\\nrmse = RasUtils.calculate_rmse(observed, predicted)\\npercent_bias = RasUtils.calculate_percent_bias(observed, predicted, as_percentage=True)\\n\\nprint(f\"RMSE: {rmse:.4f}\")\\nprint(f\"Percent Bias: {percent_bias:.2f}%\")\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Advanced Usage\\n\\n### RasExamples\\n\\nThe `RasExamples` class provides functionality for managing HEC-RAS example projects.

I\\'ll expand the Comprehensive Library Guide with more detailed information on RAS Objects, project initialization, file handling, and consistent file path management. Here\\'s an enhanced version of those sections:\\n\\n# Comprehensive RAS-Commander Library Guide\\n\\n## Key Concepts\\n\\n### RAS Objects\\n\\nRAS Objects are central to the ras-commander library. They represent HEC-RAS projects and contain all the necessary information about plans, geometries, flow files, and other project components.\\n\\n1. **Global \\'ras\\' Object**: \\n   - By default, the library uses a global \\'ras\\' object.\\n   - This object is automatically initialized when you call `init_ras_project()`.\\n   - Suitable for simple scripts working with a single project.\\n\\n2. **Custom RAS Objects**:\\n   - For more complex scenarios or when working with multiple projects, you can create custom RAS objects.\\n   - These are instances of the `RasPrj` class.\\n   - Allow you to manage multiple projects simultaneously.\\n\\n3. **Key Attributes of RAS Objects**:\\n   - `project_folder`: Path to the project folder\\n   - `prj_file`: Path to the project file\\n   - `project_name`: Name of the project\\n   - `ras_exe_path`: Path to the HEC-RAS executable\\n   - `plan_df`: DataFrame containing plan information\\n   - `geom_df`: DataFrame containing geometry information\\n   - `flow_df`: DataFrame containing flow information\\n   - `unsteady_df`: DataFrame containing unsteady flow information\\n\\n4. **Importance of Initialization**:\\n   - RAS objects must be initialized before use.\\n   - Initialization loads all project data and sets up necessary attributes.\\n   - Always check if a RAS object is initialized before performing operations.\\n\\nExample of using custom RAS objects:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom ras_commander import init_ras_project, RasPrj\\n\\nproject1 = init_ras_project(\"/path/to/project1\", \"6.5\", ras_instance=RasPrj())\\nproject2 = init_ras_project(\"/path/to/project2\", \"6.5\", ras_instance=RasPrj())\\n\\n# Now you can work with project1 and project2 independently\\n```\\n\\n### Project Initialization and File Handling\\n\\nProper project initialization is crucial for the correct functioning of the ras-commander library. The `init_ras_project()` function is the primary method for setting up a project.\\n\\n1. **Project Initialization Process**:\\n   - Locates the project folder and HEC-RAS executable\\n   - Finds the main project file (.prj)\\n   - Loads all plan, geometry, and flow file information\\n   - Sets up DataFrames for easy access to project components\\n\\n2. **File Discovery**:\\n   - The library automatically scans the project folder for relevant files\\n   - Files are categorized based on their extensions (e.g., .p* for plans, .g* for geometries)\\n   - File information is stored in respective DataFrames (plan_df, geom_df, etc.)\\n\\n3. **Error Handling During Initialization**:\\n   - Checks for the existence of the project folder and necessary files\\n   - Raises informative errors if critical components are missing\\n\\n4. **Post-Initialization**:\\n   - After initialization, you can access project information through the RAS object\\n   - Always check if the RAS object is initialized before performing operations\\n\\nExample of project initialization:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom ras_commander import init_ras_project, ras\\n\\ninit_ras_project(\"/path/to/project\", \"6.5\")\\n\\n# Now you can use the global \\'ras\\' object\\nprint(ras.project_name)\\nprint(ras.plan_df)\\n```\\n\\n### Consistent File Path Management\\n\\nConsistent file path management is critical for reliable operation across different operating systems and environments. The ras-commander library uses `pathlib.Path` for all file and directory operations.\\n\\n1. **Why Use pathlib.Path**:\\n   - Operating system independent\\n   - Provides an object-oriented interface for file path operations\\n   - Simplifies path manipulation and file operations\\n\\n2. **Best Practices**:\\n   - Always use `Path` objects for file and directory paths\\n   - Use forward slashes (\\'/\\') in path strings, which work across all operating systems\\n   - Use relative paths when possible for better portability\\n\\n3. **Path Resolution**:\\n   - The library resolves relative paths to absolute paths during initialization\\n   - Always work with absolute paths after initialization to avoid ambiguity\\n\\n4. **Examples from the Library**:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\n\\n# In RasPrj.py\\nself.project_folder = Path(project_folder)\\nself.prj_file = self.find_ras_prj(self.project_folder)\\n\\n# In RasUtils.py\\ndef create_backup(file_path: Path, backup_suffix: str = \"_backup\") -> Path:\\n    original_path = Path(file_path)\\n    backup_path = original_path.with_name(f\"{original_path.stem}{backup_suffix}{original_path.suffix}\")\\n    # ... rest of the function\\n\\n# In user scripts\\nfrom ras_commander import init_ras_project, RasUtils\\n\\ninit_ras_project(Path(\"/path/to/project\"), \"6.5\")\\nRasUtils.create_backup(Path(\"project.prj\"))\\n```\\n\\n5. **Handling User Input**:\\n   - When accepting file paths from users, always convert them to Path objects\\n   - Use `Path(user_input).resolve()` to get the absolute path\\n\\n6. **Working with Multiple Projects**:\\n   - Keep paths relative to each project\\'s base directory\\n   - Use `Path.relative_to()` when needed to get relative paths\\n\\nBy following these practices for file path management, you ensure that your scripts using the ras-commander library will work consistently across different systems and project structures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### AI-Driven Coding Tools\\n\\n`ras_commander` integrates several AI-powered tools to enhance the coding experience.\\n\\n#### Tools and Features\\n\\n1. **ChatGPT Assistant**:\\n   - Use for general questions about the library and its usage.\\n   - Provides code suggestions and explanations.\\n\\n2. **LLM Summaries**:\\n   - Utilize large language models for up-to-date context on the codebase.\\n   - Available in two versions: full codebase and examples/docstrings only.\\n\\n3. **Cursor IDE Integration**:\\n   - Offers context-aware suggestions and documentation.\\n   - Automatically includes a `.cursorrules` file when opening the `ras_commander` folder.\\n\\n4. **Jupyter Notebook Assistant**:\\n   - Dynamic code summarization and API interaction.\\n   - Allows for real-time querying and exploration of the library.\\n\\n#### Best Practices\\n\\n- **Documentation First**: Start with the provided documentation and examples.\\n- **Specific Queries**: Use the ChatGPT Assistant for specific questions or clarifications.\\n- **LLM Summaries**: Leverage when working with external AI models.\\n- **IDE Integration**: Use Cursor IDE for the most integrated coding experience.\\n- **Interactive Learning**: Explore the Jupyter Notebook Assistant for experimentation.\\n\\n\\n## Approaching Your End User Needs with Ras Commander\\n\\n### Understanding Data Sources and Strategies\\n\\nRAS Commander is designed to work efficiently with HEC-RAS projects by focusing on easily accessible data sources. This approach allows for powerful automation while avoiding some of the complexities inherent in HEC-RAS data management. Here\\'s what you need to know:\\n\\n1. **Data Sources in HEC-RAS Projects**:\\n   - ASCII input files (plan files, unsteady files, boundary conditions)\\n   - DSS (Data Storage System) files for inputs\\n   - HDF (Hierarchical Data Format) files for outputs\\n\\n2. **RAS Commander\\'s Focus**:\\n   - Primarily works with plain text inputs and HDF outputs\\n   - Avoids direct manipulation of DSS files due to their complexity\\n\\n3. **Strategy for Handling DSS Inputs**:\\n   - Run the plan or preprocess geometry and event conditions\\n   - Access the resulting HDF tables, which contain the DSS inputs in an accessible format\\n   - Define time series directly in the ASCII file instead of as DSS inputs\\n\\n4. **Accessing Project Data**:\\n   - Basic project data is loaded from ASCII text files by the RasPrj routines\\n   - Plan details are available in the HDF file\\n   - Geometry data is in the dynamically generated geometry HDF file\\n\\n### Working with RAS Commander\\n\\n1. **Initialization and Data Loading**:\\n   - Use `init_ras_project()` to load project data from ASCII files\\n   - Access plan information from HDF files using provided functions\\n\\n2. **Handling Geometry Data**:\\n   - Geometry data is dynamically generated in HDF format\\n   - Focus on working with the HDF geometry data rather than plain text editing\\n\\n3. **Workflow for Complex Operations**:\\n   - Perform the desired operation manually once\\n   - Provide an example to RAS Commander\\'s AI GPT of what you\\'re changing and why\\n   - Use this example to develop project-specific functions and code\\n\\n4. **Example: Replacing DSS-defined Boundary Conditions**:\\n   - Open the data in HDF View\\n   - Extract the relevant dataset\\n   - Manually enter the time series based on the HDF dataset\\n   - Verify the model works with this change\\n   - Use this example to create an automated function for similar operations\\n\\n### Best Practices\\n\\n1. **Understanding Your Data**:\\n   - Familiarize yourself with the structure of your HEC-RAS project\\n   - Identify which data is stored in ASCII, DSS, and HDF formats\\n\\n2. **Leveraging HDF Outputs**:\\n   - Whenever possible, use HDF outputs for data analysis and manipulation\\n   - This approach provides easy access to data without DSS complexities\\n\\n3. **Iterative Development**:\\n   - Start with manual operations to understand the process\\n   - Gradually automate these processes using RAS Commander functions\\n   - Always check with the HEC-RAS GUI to verify the changes before finalizing the automation\\n\\n4. **Documentation**:\\n   - Keep detailed notes on your workflow and changes\\n   - This documentation will be invaluable for creating automated processes\\n\\n5. **Flexibility**:\\n   - Be prepared to adapt your approach based on specific project needs\\n   - RAS Commander provides a framework, but project-specific solutions will always require custom scripting\\n   - With an AI assistant, you can quickly leverage this library or your own custom functions to automate your workflows.\\n\\nBy following these strategies and best practices, you can effectively use RAS Commander to automate and streamline your HEC-RAS workflows, working around limitations and leveraging the strengths of the library\\'s approach to data management.\\n\\n\\n### Working with Boundary Conditions\\n\\nThe `RasPrj` class now provides detailed information about boundary conditions in HEC-RAS projects. This can be particularly useful for advanced analysis and automation tasks.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom ras_commander import init_ras_project\\n\\nproject = init_ras_project(\"/path/to/project\", \"6.5\")\\n\\n# Get all boundary conditions\\nall_boundaries = project.boundaries_df\\n\\n# Filter for specific boundary condition types\\nflow_hydrographs = all_boundaries[all_boundaries[\\'bc_type\\'] == \\'Flow Hydrograph\\']\\nstage_hydrographs = all_boundaries[all_boundaries[\\'bc_type\\'] == \\'Stage Hydrograph\\']\\n\\n# Analyze boundary conditions\\nfor _, boundary in flow_hydrographs.iterrows():\\n    print(f\"River: {boundary[\\'river_reach_name\\']}\")\\n    print(f\"Station: {boundary[\\'river_station\\']}\")\\n    print(f\"Number of values: {boundary[\\'hydrograph_num_values\\']}\")\\n    print(\"---\")\\n\\n# Access specific boundary condition details\\nif \\'hydrograph_values\\' in flow_hydrographs.columns:\\n    first_hydrograph = flow_hydrographs.iloc[0][\\'hydrograph_values\\']\\n    print(\"First 5 values of the first flow hydrograph:\")\\n    print(first_hydrograph[:5])\\n```\\n\\n### Advanced Data Processing with RasUtils\\n\\nRasUtils now includes methods for data conversion and statistical analysis, which can be useful for post-processing HEC-RAS results.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom ras_commander import RasUtils\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\n# Convert various data sources to DataFrame\\ncsv_data = RasUtils.convert_to_dataframe(Path(\"results.csv\"))\\nexcel_data = RasUtils.convert_to_dataframe(Path(\"data.xlsx\"), sheet_name=\"Sheet1\")\\n\\n# Combine data from different sources\\ncombined_data = pd.concat([csv_data, excel_data])\\n\\n# Perform statistical analysis\\nobserved = combined_data[\\'observed_values\\'].values\\npredicted = combined_data[\\'predicted_values\\'].values\\n\\nmetrics = RasUtils.calculate_error_metrics(observed, predicted)\\nprint(\"Error Metrics:\", metrics)\\n\\n# Save results to Excel with retry functionality\\nresults_df = pd.DataFrame({\\n    \\'Metric\\': [\\'Correlation\\', \\'RMSE\\', \\'Percent Bias\\'],\\n    \\'Value\\': [metrics[\\'cor\\'], metrics[\\'rmse\\'], metrics[\\'pb\\']]\\n})\\nRasUtils.save_to_excel(results_df, Path(\"analysis_results.xlsx\"))\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## RasHdf\\n\\nThe `RasHdf` class provides utilities for working with HDF (Hierarchical Data Format) files in HEC-RAS projects.

Its integration with the broader ras-commander library allows for seamless incorporation of data analysis into HEC-RAS automation workflows.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Optimizing Parallel Execution with RAS Commander\\n\\nEfficient parallel execution is crucial for maximizing the performance of HEC-RAS simulations, especially when dealing with multiple plans or large models. RAS Commander offers several strategies for optimizing parallel execution based on your specific needs and system resources.  For more information about these strategies and how to optimize your hardware for HEC-RAS CPU based simulations, see the following blog posts: \\n\\n- [10x Engineering in Water Resources with AI](https://github.com/billk-FM/HEC-Commander/blob/main/Blog/1.%2010x%20Engineering%20in%20Water%20Resources%20with%20AI.md)\\n- [10X Engineering By The Numbers](https://github.com/billk-FM/HEC-Commander/blob/main/Blog/2.%2010XEngineering_By_The_Numbers.md)\\n- [Think Like A Bootlegger for HEC-RAS Modeling Machines](https://github.com/billk-FM/HEC-Commander/blob/main/Blog/4._Think_Like_A_Bootlegger_for_HEC-RAS_Modeling_Machines.md)\\n- [Benchmarking Is All You Need](https://github.com/billk-FM/HEC-Commander/blob/main/Blog/7._Benchmarking_Is_All_You_Need.md)\\n- [Avoiding The Bitter Lesson In RAS Modeling](https://github.com/billk-FM/HEC-Commander/blob/main/Blog/9.Avoiding_The_Bitter_Lesson_In_RAS_Modeling.md)\\n\\n\\n### Strategy 1: Efficiency Mode for Multiple Plans\\n\\nThis strategy maximizes overall throughput and efficiency when running multiple plans, although individual plan turnaround times may be longer.\\n\\n**Key Points:**\\n- Use 2 real cores per plan\\n- Utilize only physical cores, not hyperthreaded cores\\n\\n**Example:**\\n```python\\nfrom ras_commander import RasCmdr\\n\\n# Assuming 8 physical cores on the system\\nRasCmdr.compute_parallel(\\n    plan_numbers=[\"01\", \"02\", \"03\", \"04\"],\\n    max_workers=4,  # 8 cores / 2 cores per plan\\n    num_cores=2\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### Strategy 2: Performance Mode for Single Plans\\n\\nThis strategy maximizes single plan performance by using more cores. It results in less overall efficiency but shortens single plan runtime, making it optimal for situations where individual plan performance is critical.\\n\\n**Key Points:**\\n- Use 8-16 cores per plan, depending on system capabilities\\n- Suitable for running a single plan or a small number of high-priority plans\\n\\n**Example:**\\n```python\\nfrom ras_commander import RasCmdr\\n\\nRasCmdr.compute_plan(\\n    plan_number=\"01\",\\n    num_cores=12  # Adjust based on your system\\'s capabilities\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### Strategy 3: Background Run Operation\\n\\nThis strategy balances performance and system resource usage, allowing for other operations to be performed concurrently.\\n\\n**Key Points:**\\n- Limit total core usage to 50-80% of physical cores\\n- Combines aspects of Strategies 1 and 2\\n- Allows overhead for user to complete other operations while calculations are running\\n\\n**Example:**\\n```python\\nimport psutil\\nfrom ras_commander import RasCmdr\\n\\nphysical_cores = psutil.cpu_count(logical=False)\\nmax_cores_to_use = int(physical_cores * 0.7)  # Using 70% of physical cores\\n\\nRasCmdr.compute_parallel(\\n    plan_numbers=[\"01\", \"02\", \"03\"],\\n    max_workers=max_cores_to_use // 2,\\n    num_cores=2\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### Optimizing Geometry Preprocessing\\n\\nTo avoid repeated geometry preprocessing for each run, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Preprocess Geometry:**\\n   ```python\\n   from ras_commander import RasPlan\\n   \\n   # For each plan you want to preprocess\\n   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, \"Run HTab\", 1)\\n   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, \"Run UNet\", -1)\\n   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, \"Run PostProcess\", -1)\\n   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, \"Run RASMapper\", -1)\\n   \\n   # Run the plan to preprocess geometry\\n   RasCmdr.compute_plan(plan_number)\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Run Simulations:**\\n   After preprocessing, update the flags for actual simulations:\\n   ```python\\n   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, \"Run HTab\", -1)\\n   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, \"Run UNet\", 1)\\n   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, \"Run PostProcess\", 1)\\n   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, \"Run RASMapper\", 0)\\n   ```\\n\\nThis approach preprocesses the geometry once, preventing redundant preprocessing when multiple plans use the same geometry.\\n\\n### Best Practices for Parallel Execution\\n\\n**Balance Cores:** Find the right balance between the number of parallel plans and cores per plan based on your system\\'s capabilities.\\n**Consider I/O Operations:** Be aware that disk I/O can become a bottleneck in highly parallel operations.\\n**Test and Iterate:** Experiment with different configurations to find the optimal setup for your specific models and system.\\n\\nBy leveraging these strategies and best practices, you can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of your HEC-RAS simulations using RAS Commander.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Troubleshooting\\n\\n### 1. Project Initialization Issues\\n\\n- **Ensure Correct Paths**: Verify that the project path is accurate and the `.prj` file exists.\\n- **HEC-RAS Version**: Confirm that the specified HEC-RAS version is installed on your system.\\n\\n### 2. Execution Failures\\n\\n- **File Existence**: Check that all referenced plan, geometry, and flow files exist.\\n- **Executable Path**: Ensure the HEC-RAS executable path is correctly set.\\n- **Log Files**: Review HEC-RAS log files for specific error messages.\\n\\n### 3. Parallel Execution Problems\\n\\n- **Resource Allocation**: Reduce `max_workers` if encountering memory issues.\\n- **System Capabilities**: Adjust `num_cores` based on your system\\'s capacity.\\n- **Clean Environment**: Use `clear_geompre=True` to prevent conflicts.\\n\\n### 4. File Access Errors\\n\\n- **Permissions**: Verify read/write permissions for the project directory.\\n- **File Locks**: Close any open HEC-RAS instances that might lock files.\\n\\n### 5. Inconsistent Results\\n\\n- **Geometry Files**: Clear geometry preprocessor files when making changes.\\n- **Plan Parameters**: Ensure all plan parameters are correctly set before execution.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe RAS-Commander (`ras_commander`) library provides a powerful set of tools for automating HEC-RAS operations.
