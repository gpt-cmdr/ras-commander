    "# RAS Commander: Sequential Plan Execution\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates how to sequentially execute multiple HEC-RAS plans using the RAS Commander library. Sequential execution is useful for batch processing plans that need to be run in a specific order or when you want to ensure consistent resource usage across multiple runs.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Project Initialization**: Initialize a HEC-RAS project by specifying the project path and version\n",
    "2. **Sequential Execution of All Plans**: Run all plans in a project sequentially in a test folder\n",
    "3. **Selective Plan Execution**: Run only specific plans in sequence\n",
    "4. **Geometry Preprocessor Management**: Clear geometry preprocessor files before execution\n",
    "5. **Execution Result Analysis**: Track and analyze the results of sequential executions\n",
    "6. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor and compare execution times across different runs\n",

    "## Understanding Sequential Execution in HEC-RAS\n",
    "\n",
    "HEC-RAS simulations can be executed in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Plan Execution**: Run one plan at a time using `RasCmdr.compute_plan()`\n",
    "2. **Sequential Execution**: Run multiple plans one after another using `RasCmdr.compute_test_mode()`\n",
    "3. **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple plans simultaneously using `RasCmdr.compute_parallel()`\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on the second approach: **Sequential Execution**. Here are the key benefits of sequential execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Controlled Resource Usage**: By running plans one at a time, you ensure consistent resource usage\n",
    "- **Dependency Management**: When later plans depend on results from earlier plans\n",
    "- **Simplified Debugging**: Easier to identify which plan is causing an issue when they run sequentially\n",
    "- **Consistent Test Environment**: All plans run in the same isolated folder\n",
    "\n",
    "The `compute_test_mode()` function from `RasCmdr` is specifically designed for this purpose. It creates a separate test folder, copies the project there, and executes the specified plans in sequential order."

    "\n",
    "Before we start executing plans, let's understand the `compute_test_mode()` method from the `RasCmdr` class, which we'll use for sequential execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- `plan_number` (str, list[str], optional): Plan number or list of plan numbers to execute. If None, all plans will be executed.\n",
    "- `dest_folder_suffix` (str, optional): Suffix to append to the test folder name. Defaults to \"[Test]\".\n",
    "- `clear_geompre` (bool, optional): Whether to clear geometry preprocessor files. Defaults to False.\n",
    "- `num_cores` (int, optional): Maximum number of cores to use for each plan. If None, the current setting is not changed.\n",
    "- `ras_object` (RasPrj, optional): Specific RAS object to use. If None, uses the global ras object.\n",
    "- `overwrite_dest` (bool, optional): Whether to overwrite the destination folder if it exists. Defaults to False.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Return Value\n",
    "- `Dict[str, bool]`: Dictionary of plan numbers and their execution success status.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Test Folder**: The function creates a separate folder with the specified suffix, copying the project there for execution.\n",
    "2. **Sequential Execution**: Plans are executed one after another in the specified order.\n",
    "3. **Geometry Preprocessor Files**: These files store precomputed hydraulic properties. Clearing them forces HEC-RAS to recompute these properties.\n",
    "4. **Destination Folder Option**: The suffix determines the name of the test folder. Unlike `compute_plan()`, you can't specify an arbitrary destination folder.\n",
    "5. **Overwrite Option**: Controls whether an existing test folder should be overwritten.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Key Functions Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- `init_ras_project()`: Initialize a HEC-RAS project\n",
    "- `RasExamples.extract_project()`: Extract example projects for testing\n",
    "- `RasCmdr.compute_test_mode()`: Run plans sequentially in a test folder\n",
    "- `Path.glob()`: Examine test folder contents and results\n",
    "- `RasCmdr.compute_test_mode(clear_geompre=True)`: Execute plans with preprocessor clearing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Sequential Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure all required libraries are installed and properly imported\n",
    "2. **Project Organization**: Clean up existing test folders before new executions\n",
    "3. **Resource Management**: Monitor system resources (CPU cores, memory) for optimal performance\n",
    "4. **Test Folder Naming**: Use meaningful suffixes to distinguish different execution runs\n",
    "5. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor execution times for each sequential run\n",
    "6. **Results Verification**: Check test folders for successful plan execution and result files\n",
    "7. **Selective Execution**: Use plan filtering when only specific plans need to be run\n",
