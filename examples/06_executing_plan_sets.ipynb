    "## Understanding Plan Specification in HEC-RAS\n",
    "\n",
    "In HEC-RAS, each plan (`.p*` file) represents a specific hydraulic model simulation scenario. When working with RAS Commander, you can specify plans for execution in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Plan**: Specify one plan by its number (e.g., \"01\")\n",
    "2. **List of Plans**: Specify multiple plans as a list (e.g., [\"01\", \"03\", \"05\"])\n",
    "3. **All Plans**: Execute all plans in a project by not specifying any plan or passing `None`\n",
    "4. **Filtered Plans**: Select plans based on criteria (e.g., plans with specific flow conditions)\n",
    "5. **Plan Path**: Specify the full path to a plan file instead of just the number\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Plan Specification Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Run only the plans you need rather than recomputing everything\n",
    "- **Organization**: Group related plans for batch processing\n",
    "- **Automation**: Create workflows that process plans in a specific order\n",
    "- **Resource Management**: Optimize hardware utilization for specific plans\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Plan Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use consistent formatting for plan numbers (e.g., always use two-digit strings like \"01\" instead of 1)\n",
    "- Check available plans before attempting to execute them\n",
    "- Organize plans by purpose to make selection easier\n",
    "- Use descriptive short identifiers and plan titles to aid in selection"

    "## Summary of Plan Specification Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've explored different ways to specify and execute HEC-RAS plans using the RAS Commander library. Here's a summary of the key techniques we've covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Plan Specification**\n",
    "   - Single plan by number: `\"01\"`\n",
    "   - List of specific plans: `[\"01\", \"03\"]`\n",
    "   - All plans: `ras.plan_df['plan_number'].tolist()`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advanced Selection**\n",
    "   - Categorization: Grouping plans by purpose or type\n",
    "   - Dependencies: Ensuring prerequisite plans are run first\n",
    "   - Ordered execution: Running plans in a specific sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run Plans with Missing Results (HDF)**\n",
    "   - Using ras object to determine which plans have results\n",
    "   - Creating a list of plans with no results\n",
    "   - Running those plans sequentially\n",
    "\n",
    "4. NOTE: run_parallel can also run a list of plans, but compute_plan is only made for single plan execution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Plan Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consistent Formatting**: Use two-digit strings for plan numbers (\"01\" instead of 1)\n",
    "2. **Descriptive Naming**: Use meaningful short identifiers that describe the plan's purpose\n",
    "3. **Verify Availability**: Check that specified plans exist before trying to execute them\n",
    "4. **Document Dependencies**: Keep track of which plans depend on others\n",
    "5. **Use Appropriate Execution Method**: Choose sequential or parallel based on dependencies and resources\n",
    "6. **Monitor Performance**: Track execution times to identify optimization opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying these techniques, you can create efficient and organized workflows for executing HEC-RAS plans, from simple batch processing to complex dependency-based execution sequences."
