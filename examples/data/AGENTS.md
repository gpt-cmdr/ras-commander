**Scope**
- Small reference datasets used by notebooks (e.g., Atlas 14 CSVs, GeoJSON test lines). Not intended for modification or expansion by agents.

**Agent Guidance**
- Read-only usage: safe to load for examples and smoke checks.
- Do not add large files or generated outputs here; place working data in `working/` at repo root.
- Prefer programmatic downloads (via `RasExamples` or explicit URLs) to keep the repo lean.
