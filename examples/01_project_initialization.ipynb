    "1. **Project-Centric Architecture**: Everything revolves around HEC-RAS projects\n",

    "After exploring both approaches, here are some best practices for using RAS Commander:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose Your Approach Based on Complexity**:\n",
    "   - **Simple Scripts** (one project): Use the global `ras` object\n",
    "   - **Complex Scripts** (multiple projects): Use custom RAS objects\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Be Consistent**:\n",
    "   - Don't mix global and custom approaches in the same script\n",
    "   - Use descriptive names for custom RAS objects\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Working with Project Files**:\n",
    "   - Access project files through the RAS object's DataFrames\n",
    "   - Use helper functions like `get_plan_path()` to resolve paths\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - Always check for empty DataFrames before accessing their contents\n",
    "   - Use the built-in logging to track operations\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Performance Considerations**:\n",
    "   - For large projects, consider using the HDF classes directly\n",
    "   - Cache results of expensive operations when possible\n",
