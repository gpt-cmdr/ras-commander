## How to Use This File

### Session Entry Format
Copy the template above for each new session. Always include:
1. **Summary**: Quick overview (read this if short on time)
2. **Work Done**: Specific accomplishments
3. **Decisions Made**: Rationale for choices (future you will thank you)
4. **Handoff Notes**: What next session needs to continue
5. **Files Changed**: Quick reference for what was modified

### Best Practices
- Write entries as if the next reader knows nothing about current context
- Include commit hashes for significant changes
- Note any partial work that needs completion
- Flag any issues discovered but not addressed
