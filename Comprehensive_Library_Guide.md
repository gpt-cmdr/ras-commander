## Best Practices

### 1. RAS Object Usage

- **Single Project Scripts**:
  - Use the global `ras` object for simplicity.
    ```python
    from ras_commander import ras, init_ras_project

    init_ras_project("/path/to/project", "6.5")
    # Use ras object for operations
    ```

- **Multiple Projects**:
  - Create separate `RasPrj` instances for each project.
    ```python
    from ras_commander import RasPrj, init_ras_project

    project1 = init_ras_project("/path/to/project1", "6.5", ras_instance=RasPrj())
    project2 = init_ras_project("/path/to/project2", "6.5", ras_instance=RasPrj())
    ```

- **Consistency**:
  - Avoid mixing global and custom RAS objects in the same script.

### 2. Plan Specification

- Use plan numbers as strings (e.g., `"01"`, `"02"`) for consistency.
  ```python
  RasCmdr.compute_plan("01")
  ```

- Check available plans before specifying plan numbers.
  ```python
  print(ras.plan_df)  # Displays available plans
  ```

### 3. Geometry Preprocessor Files

- Clear geometry preprocessor files before significant changes.
  ```python
  RasGeo.clear_geompre_files()
  ```

- Use `clear_geompre=True` for a clean computation environment.
  ```python
  RasCmdr.compute_plan("01", clear_geompre=True)
  ```

### 4. Parallel Execution

- Adjust `max_workers` and `num_cores` based on system capabilities.
  ```python
  RasCmdr.compute_parallel(max_workers=4, num_cores=2)
  ```

- Use `dest_folder` to organize outputs and prevent conflicts.
  ```python
  RasCmdr.compute_parallel(dest_folder="/path/to/results")
  ```

### 5. Error Handling and Logging

Proper error handling and logging are crucial for robust RAS Commander scripts. The library provides built-in logging functionality to help you track operations and diagnose issues.

1. **Logging Setup**:
   RAS Commander automatically sets up basic logging. You can adjust the log level:

   ```python
   import logging
   logging.getLogger('ras_commander').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
   ```

2. **Using the @log_call Decorator**:
   The `@log_call` decorator automatically logs function calls:

   ```python
   from ras_commander.Decorators import log_call

   @log_call
   def my_function():
       # Function implementation
   ```

3. **Custom Logging**:
   For more detailed logging, use the logger directly:

   ```python
   from ras_commander.LoggingConfig import get_logger

   logger = get_logger(__name__)

   def my_function():
       logger.info("Starting operation")
       try:
           # Operation code
       except Exception as e:
           logger.error(f"Operation failed: {str(e)}")
   ```

4. **Error Handling Best Practices**:
   - Use specific exception types when possible.
   - Provide informative error messages.
   - Consider using custom exceptions for library-specific errors.

   ```python
   class RasCommanderError(Exception):
       pass

   def my_function():
       try:
           # Operation code
       except FileNotFoundError as e:
           raise RasCommanderError(f"Required file not found: {str(e)}")
       except ValueError as e:
           raise RasCommanderError(f"Invalid input: {str(e)}")
   ```

5. **Logging to File**:
   To save logs to a file, configure a file handler:

   ```python
   import logging
   from ras_commander.LoggingConfig import setup_logging

   setup_logging(log_file='ras_commander.log', log_level=logging.DEBUG)
   ```

### 6. File Path Handling

- Use `pathlib.Path` for robust file and directory operations.
  ```python
  from pathlib import Path
  project_path = Path("/path/to/project")
  ```

### 7. Type Hinting

- Apply type hints to improve code readability and IDE support.
  ```python
  from typing import Union, List, Optional
  def compute_plan(plan_number: str, clear_geompre: bool = False) -> bool:
      ...
  ```

## Usage Patterns

### Initializing a Project
```python
from ras_commander import init_ras_project, ras

init_ras_project("/path/to/project", "6.5")
print(f"Working with project: {ras.project_name}")
```

### Cloning a Plan

```python
from ras_commander import RasPlan

new_plan_number = RasPlan.clone_plan("01")
print(f"Created new plan: {new_plan_number}")
```


### Executing Plans

- **Single Plan Execution**:
  ```python
  from ras_commander import RasCmdr

  success = RasCmdr.compute_plan("01", num_cores=2)
  print(f"Plan execution {'successful' if success else 'failed'}")
  ```

- **Parallel Execution of Multiple Plans**:
  ```python
  from ras_commander import RasCmdr

  results = RasCmdr.compute_parallel(
      plan_number=["01", "02", "03"],
      max_workers=3,
      num_cores=4,
      dest_folder="/path/to/results",
      clear_geompre=True
  )

  for plan, success in results.items():
      print(f"Plan {plan}: {'Successful' if success else 'Failed'}")
  ```

### Working with Multiple Projects

```python
from ras_commander import RasPrj, init_ras_project, RasCmdr

# Initialize two separate projects
project1 = init_ras_project("/path/to/project1", "6.5", ras_instance=RasPrj())
project2 = init_ras_project("/path/to/project2", "6.5", ras_instance=RasPrj())

# Perform operations on each project
RasCmdr.compute_plan("01", ras_object=project1)
RasCmdr.compute_plan("02", ras_object=project2)

# Compare results
results1 = project1.get_hdf_entries()
results2 = project2.get_hdf_entries()
```

## Advanced Usage

### Working with HDF Files

RAS Commander provides extensive support for working with HDF files through various specialized classes. Here's an overview of key operations:

1. **Reading HDF Data**:
   Use `HdfUtils.get_hdf_paths_with_properties()` to explore the structure of an HDF file:

   ```python
   from ras_commander import HdfUtils

   hdf_paths = HdfUtils.get_hdf_paths_with_properties(hdf_path)
   print(hdf_paths)
   ```

2. **Extracting Mesh Results**:
   Use `HdfResultsMesh` to extract mesh-related results:

   ```python
   from ras_commander import HdfResultsMesh

   water_surface = HdfResultsMesh.mesh_timeseries_output(hdf_path, mesh_name, "Water Surface")
   print(water_surface)
   ```

3. **Working with Plan Results**:
   Use `HdfResultsPlan` for plan-specific results:

   ```python
   from ras_commander import HdfResultsPlan

   runtime_data = HdfResultsPlan.get_runtime_data(hdf_path)
   print(runtime_data)
   ```

4. **Cross-Section Results**:
   Extract cross-section data using `HdfResultsXsec`:

   ```python
   from ras_commander import HdfResultsXsec

   wsel_data = HdfResultsXsec.cross_sections_wsel(hdf_path)
   print(wsel_data)
   ```

These classes provide a high-level interface to HDF data, making it easier to extract and analyze HEC-RAS results programmatically.


### Working with Pipe Networks and Pump Stations


RAS Commander provides specialized classes for handling pipe networks and pump stations data from HEC-RAS HDF files.

1. **Pipe Network Operations**:
   Use `HdfPipe` to extract and analyze pipe network data:

   ```python
   from ras_commander import HdfPipe
   from pathlib import Path

   hdf_path = Path("path/to/your/hdf_file.hdf")

   # Extract pipe conduit data
   pipe_conduits = HdfPipe.get_pipe_conduits(hdf_path)
   print(pipe_conduits)

   # Extract pipe node data
   pipe_nodes = HdfPipe.get_pipe_nodes(hdf_path)
   print(pipe_nodes)

   # Get pipe network timeseries data
   water_surface = HdfPipe.get_pipe_network_timeseries(hdf_path, "Cell Water Surface")
   print(water_surface)

   # Get pipe network summary
   summary = HdfPipe.get_pipe_network_summary(hdf_path)
   print(summary)

   # Get pipe profile for a specific conduit
   profile = HdfPipe.get_pipe_profile(hdf_path, conduit_id=0)
   print(profile)
   ```


2. **Pump Station Operations**:


   Use `HdfPump` to work with pump station data:

   ```python
   from ras_commander import HdfPump
   from pathlib import Path

   hdf_path = Path("path/to/your/hdf_file.hdf")

   # Extract pump station data
   pump_stations = HdfPump.get_pump_stations(hdf_path)
   print(pump_stations)

   # Get pump group data
   pump_groups = HdfPump.get_pump_groups(hdf_path)
   print(pump_groups)

   # Get pump station timeseries data
   pump_data = HdfPump.get_pump_station_timeseries(hdf_path, "Pump Station 1")
   print(pump_data)

   # Get pump station summary
   summary = HdfPump.get_pump_station_summary(hdf_path)
   print(summary)

   # Get pump operation data
   operation_data = HdfPump.get_pump_operation_data(hdf_path, "Pump Station 1")
   print(operation_data)
   ```

These classes provide powerful tools for analyzing and visualizing pipe network and pump station data from HEC-RAS simulations. They allow you to easily access geometric information, time series data, and summary statistics for these hydraulic structures.






### Performance Optimization

Optimizing performance in RAS Commander involves balancing between execution speed and resource utilization. Here are detailed strategies:

1. **Parallel Execution**:
   Use `RasCmdr.compute_parallel()` for running multiple plans concurrently:

   ```python
   from ras_commander import RasCmdr

   results = RasCmdr.compute_parallel(
       plan_numbers=["01", "02", "03"],
       max_workers=3,
       num_cores=4
   )
   ```

   - Adjust `max_workers` based on the number of plans and available system resources.
   - Set `num_cores` to balance between single-plan performance and overall throughput.

2. **Geometry Preprocessing**:
   Preprocess geometry to avoid redundant calculations:

   ```python
   from ras_commander import RasPlan

   RasPlan.set_geom_preprocessor(plan_path, run_htab=1, use_ib_tables=0)
   ```

   - Set `run_htab=1` to force geometry preprocessing.
   - Use `use_ib_tables=0` to recompute internal boundary tables.

3. **Memory Management**:
   When working with large datasets, use chunking and iterative processing:

   ```python
   import dask.array as da
   from ras_commander import HdfResultsMesh

   data = HdfResultsMesh.mesh_timeseries_output(hdf_path, mesh_name, "Water Surface")
   dask_array = da.from_array(data.values, chunks=(1000, 1000))
   ```

4. **I/O Optimization**:
   Minimize disk I/O by batching read/write operations:

   ```python
   from ras_commander import HdfUtils

   with h5py.File(hdf_path, 'r') as hdf_file:
       datasets = HdfUtils.get_hdf_paths_with_properties(hdf_file)
       # Process multiple datasets in a single file open operation
   ```

5. **Profiling and Monitoring**:
   Use Python's built-in profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks:

   ```python
   import cProfile

   cProfile.run('RasCmdr.compute_plan("01")')
   ```

By applying these strategies, you can significantly improve the performance of your RAS Commander scripts, especially when dealing with large projects or multiple simulations.

### Working with Boundary Conditions

RAS Commander provides powerful tools for managing and analyzing boundary conditions in HEC-RAS projects. Here's how to work effectively with boundary conditions:

1. **Accessing Boundary Conditions**:
   Use the `boundaries_df` attribute of the RasPrj object:

   ```python
   from ras_commander import init_ras_project

   project = init_ras_project("/path/to/project", "6.5")
   boundary_conditions = project.boundaries_df
   print(boundary_conditions)
   ```

2. **Filtering Boundary Conditions**:
   You can easily filter boundary conditions by type or location:

   ```python
   # Get all flow hydrographs
   flow_hydrographs = boundary_conditions[boundary_conditions['bc_type'] == 'Flow Hydrograph']

   # Get boundary conditions for a specific river
   river_boundaries = boundary_conditions[boundary_conditions['river_reach_name'] == 'Main River']
   ```

3. **Analyzing Boundary Condition Data**:
   Extract detailed information from boundary conditions:

   ```python
   for _, bc in flow_hydrographs.iterrows():
       print(f"River: {bc['river_reach_name']}")
       print(f"Station: {bc['river_station']}")
       print(f"Number of values: {bc['hydrograph_num_values']}")
       print("---")
   ```

4. **Modifying Boundary Conditions**:
   While direct modification of boundary conditions is not supported, you can use RAS Commander to update unsteady flow files:

   ```python
   from ras_commander import RasUnsteady

   RasUnsteady.update_unsteady_parameters(unsteady_file_path, {"Parameter1": "NewValue1"})
   ```

5. **Visualizing Boundary Conditions**:
   Use pandas and matplotlib to visualize boundary condition data:

   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   bc = flow_hydrographs.iloc[0]
   plt.plot(bc['hydrograph_values'])
   plt.title(f"Flow Hydrograph: {bc['name']}")
   plt.xlabel("Time Step")
   plt.ylabel("Flow")
   plt.show()
   ```

By leveraging these capabilities, you can effectively analyze and manage boundary conditions in your HEC-RAS projects using RAS Commander.

### Advanced Data Processing with RasUtils

RasUtils provides a set of powerful tools for data processing and analysis. Here are some advanced techniques:

1. **Data Conversion**:
   Convert various data sources to pandas DataFrames:

   ```python
   from ras_commander import RasUtils
   from pathlib import Path

   csv_data = RasUtils.convert_to_dataframe(Path("results.csv"))
   excel_data = RasUtils.convert_to_dataframe(Path("data.xlsx"), sheet_name="Sheet1")
   ```

2. **Statistical Analysis**:
   Perform statistical calculations on simulation results:

   ```python
   import numpy as np

   observed = np.array([100, 120, 140, 160, 180])
   predicted = np.array([105, 125, 135, 165, 175])

   rmse = RasUtils.calculate_rmse(observed, predicted)
   percent_bias = RasUtils.calculate_percent_bias(observed, predicted, as_percentage=True)
   metrics = RasUtils.calculate_error_metrics(observed, predicted)

   print(f"RMSE: {rmse}")
   print(f"Percent Bias: {percent_bias}%")
   print(f"Metrics: {metrics}")
   ```

3. **Spatial Operations**:
   Perform spatial queries and nearest neighbor searches:

   ```python
   import numpy as np

   points = np.array([[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2], [10, 10]])
   query_points = np.array([[0.5, 0.5], [5, 5]])

   nearest = RasUtils.perform_kdtree_query(points, query_points)
   neighbors = RasUtils.find_nearest_neighbors(points)

   print(f"Nearest points: {nearest}")
   print(f"Neighbors: {neighbors}")
   ```

4. **Data Consolidation**:
   Consolidate and pivot complex datasets:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 1, 2], 'B': [4, 5, 6], 'C': [7, 8, 9]})
   consolidated = RasUtils.consolidate_dataframe(df, group_by='A', aggregation_method='list')

   print(consolidated)
   ```

5. **File Operations**:
   Perform advanced file operations with built-in error handling:

   ```python
   from pathlib import Path

   directory = Path("output")
   RasUtils.create_directory(directory)

   file_path = directory / "data.txt"
   RasUtils.check_file_access(file_path, mode='w')

   # Perform file operation here

   RasUtils.remove_with_retry(file_path, is_folder=False)
   ```

By utilizing these advanced data processing capabilities of RasUtils, you can efficiently handle complex data manipulation tasks in your RAS Commander workflows.

ras_examples = RasExamples()

# Download example projects (if not already present)
ras_examples.get_example_projects()

# List available categories
categories = ras_examples.list_categories()
print(f"Available categories: {categories}")

# List projects in a specific category
steady_flow_projects = ras_examples.list_projects("Steady Flow")
print(f"Steady Flow projects: {steady_flow_projects}")

# Extract specific projects
extracted_paths = ras_examples.extract_project(["Bald Eagle Creek", "Muncie"])
for path in extracted_paths:
    print(f"Extracted project to: {path}")

# Clean up extracted projects when done
ras_examples.clean_projects_directory()
```

## RasHdf

The `RasHdf` class provides utilities for working with HDF (Hierarchical Data Format) files in HEC-RAS projects. HDF files are commonly used in HEC-RAS for storing large datasets and simulation results.

### Key Features of `RasHdf`:

1. **Reading HDF Tables**: Convert HDF5 datasets to pandas DataFrames.
2. **Writing DataFrames to HDF**: Save pandas DataFrames as HDF5 datasets.
3. **Spatial Operations**: Perform KDTree queries and find nearest neighbors.
4. **Data Consolidation**: Merge duplicate values in DataFrames.
5. **Byte String Handling**: Decode byte strings in DataFrames.

### Example Usage:

```python
from ras_commander import RasHdf
import h5py
import pandas as pd

# Read an HDF table
with h5py.File('results.hdf', 'r') as f:
    dataset = f['water_surface_elevations']
    df = RasHdf.read_hdf_to_dataframe(dataset)

print(df.head())

# Save a DataFrame to HDF
new_data = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': ['a', 'b', 'c']})
with h5py.File('new_results.hdf', 'w') as f:
    group = f.create_group('my_results')
    RasHdf.save_dataframe_to_hdf(new_data, group, 'my_dataset')

# Perform a KDTree query
import numpy as np
reference_points = np.array([[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2]])
query_points = np.array([[0.5, 0.5], [1.5, 1.5]])
results = RasHdf.perform_kdtree_query(reference_points, query_points)
print("KDTree query results:", results)
```

## Optimizing Parallel Execution with RAS Commander

Efficient parallel execution is crucial for maximizing the performance of HEC-RAS simulations, especially when dealing with multiple plans or large models. RAS Commander offers several strategies for optimizing parallel execution based on your specific needs and system resources.

### Strategy 1: Efficiency Mode for Multiple Plans

This strategy maximizes overall throughput and efficiency when running multiple plans, although individual plan turnaround times may be longer.

**Key Points:**
- Use 2 real cores per plan
- Utilize only physical cores, not hyperthreaded cores

**Example:**
```python
from ras_commander import RasCmdr

# Assuming 8 physical cores on the system
RasCmdr.compute_parallel(
    plan_numbers=["01", "02", "03", "04"],
    max_workers=4,  # 8 cores / 2 cores per plan
    num_cores=2
)
```

### Strategy 2: Performance Mode for Single Plans

This strategy maximizes single plan performance by using more cores. It results in less overall efficiency but shortens single plan runtime, making it optimal for situations where individual plan performance is critical.

**Key Points:**
- Use 8-16 cores per plan, depending on system capabilities
- Suitable for running a single plan or a small number of high-priority plans

**Example:**
```python
from ras_commander import RasCmdr

RasCmdr.compute_plan(
    plan_number="01",
    num_cores=12  # Adjust based on your system's capabilities
)
```

### Strategy 3: Background Run Operation

This strategy balances performance and system resource usage, allowing for other operations to be performed concurrently.

**Key Points:**
- Limit total core usage to 50-80% of physical cores
- Combines aspects of Strategies 1 and 2
- Allows overhead for user to complete other operations while calculations are running

**Example:**
```python
import psutil
from ras_commander import RasCmdr

physical_cores = psutil.cpu_count(logical=False)
max_cores_to_use = int(physical_cores * 0.7)  # Using 70% of physical cores

RasCmdr.compute_parallel(
    plan_numbers=["01", "02", "03"],
    max_workers=max_cores_to_use // 2,
    num_cores=2
)
```

### Optimizing Geometry Preprocessing

To avoid repeated geometry preprocessing for each run, follow these steps:

1. **Preprocess Geometry:**
   ```python
   from ras_commander import RasPlan
   
   # For each plan you want to preprocess
   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, "Run HTab", 1)
   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, "Run UNet", -1)
   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, "Run PostProcess", -1)
   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, "Run RASMapper", -1)
   
   # Run the plan to preprocess geometry
   RasCmdr.compute_plan(plan_number)
   ```

2. **Run Simulations:**
   After preprocessing, update the flags for actual simulations:
   ```python
   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, "Run HTab", -1)
   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, "Run UNet", 1)
   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, "Run PostProcess", 1)
   RasPlan.update_plan_value(plan_number, "Run RASMapper", 0)
   ```

This approach preprocesses the geometry once, preventing redundant preprocessing when multiple plans use the same geometry.

### Best Practices for Parallel Execution

- **Balance Cores:** Find the right balance between the number of parallel plans and cores per plan based on your system's capabilities.
- **Consider I/O Operations:** Be aware that disk I/O can become a bottleneck in highly parallel operations.
- **Test and Iterate:** Experiment with different configurations to find the optimal setup for your specific models and system.

By leveraging these strategies and best practices, you can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of your HEC-RAS simulations using RAS Commander.

## Approaching Your End User Needs with Ras Commander

### Understanding Data Sources and Strategies

RAS Commander is designed to work efficiently with HEC-RAS projects by focusing on easily accessible data sources. This approach allows for powerful automation while avoiding some of the complexities inherent in HEC-RAS data management. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Data Sources in HEC-RAS Projects**:
   - ASCII input files (plan files, unsteady files, boundary conditions)
   - DSS (Data Storage System) files for inputs
   - HDF (Hierarchical Data Format) files for outputs

2. **RAS Commander's Focus**:
   - Primarily works with plain text inputs and HDF outputs
   - Avoids direct manipulation of DSS files due to their complexity

3. **Strategy for Handling DSS Inputs**:
   - Run the plan or preprocess geometry and event conditions
   - Access the resulting HDF tables, which contain the DSS inputs in an accessible format
   - Define time series directly in the ASCII file instead of as DSS inputs

4. **Accessing Project Data**:
   - Basic project data is loaded from ASCII text files by the RasPrj routines
   - Plan details are available in the HDF file
   - Geometry data is in the dynamically generated geometry HDF file

### Working with RAS Commander

1. **Initialization and Data Loading**:
   - Use `init_ras_project()` to load project data from ASCII files
   - Access plan information from HDF files using provided functions

2. **Handling Geometry Data**:
   - Geometry data is dynamically generated in HDF format
   - Focus on working with the HDF geometry data rather than plain text editing

3. **Workflow for Complex Operations**:
   - Perform the desired operation manually once
   - Provide an example to RAS Commander's AI GPT of what you're changing and why
   - Use this example to develop project-specific functions and code

4. **Example: Replacing DSS-defined Boundary Conditions**:
   - Open the data in HDF View
   - Extract the relevant dataset
   - Manually enter the time series based on the HDF dataset
   - Verify the model works with this change
   - Use this example to create an automated function for similar operations

### Best Practices

1. **Understanding Your Data**:
   - Familiarize yourself with the structure of your HEC-RAS project
   - Identify which data is stored in ASCII, DSS, and HDF formats

2. **Leveraging HDF Outputs**:
   - Whenever possible, use HDF outputs for data analysis and manipulation
   - This approach provides easy access to data without DSS complexities

3. **Iterative Development**:
   - Start with manual operations to understand the process
   - Gradually automate these processes using RAS Commander functions
   - Always check with the HEC-RAS GUI to verify the changes before finalizing the automation

4. **Documentation**:
   - Keep detailed notes on your workflow and changes
   - This documentation will be invaluable for creating automated processes

5. **Flexibility**:
   - Be prepared to adapt your approach based on specific project needs
   - RAS Commander provides a framework, but project-specific solutions will always require custom scripting
   - With an AI assistant, you can quickly leverage this library or your own custom functions to automate your workflows.

By following these strategies and best practices, you can effectively use RAS Commander to automate and streamline your HEC-RAS workflows, working around limitations and leveraging the strengths of the library's approach to data management.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Project Initialization Issues

- **Ensure Correct Paths**: Verify that the project path is accurate and the `.prj` file exists.
- **HEC-RAS Version**: Confirm that the specified HEC-RAS version is installed on your system.

### 2. Execution Failures

- **File Existence**: Check that all referenced plan, geometry, and flow files exist.
- **Executable Path**: Ensure the HEC-RAS executable path is correctly set.
- **Log Files**: Review HEC-RAS log files for specific error messages.

### 3. Parallel Execution Problems

- **Resource Allocation**: Reduce `max_workers` if encountering memory issues.
- **System Capabilities**: Adjust `num_cores` based on your system's capacity.
- **Clean Environment**: Use `clear_geompre=True` to prevent conflicts.

### 4. File Access Errors

- **Permissions**: Verify read/write permissions for the project directory.
- **File Locks**: Close any open HEC-RAS instances that might lock files.

### 5. Inconsistent Results

- **Geometry Files**: Clear geometry preprocessor files when making changes.
- **Plan Parameters**: Ensure all plan parameters are correctly set before execution.

**Note on Module Naming Convention:**
While the library now uses capitalized names for the `Decorators.py` and `LoggingConfig.py` modules, it's worth noting that this deviates from the PEP 8 style guide, which recommends lowercase names for modules. Future versions of the library may revert to lowercase naming for consistency with Python conventions. Users should be aware of this potential change in future updates.
