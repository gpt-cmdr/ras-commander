Search through your agents and skills and make a detailed plan to execute the user's query. Use the agents to save context and use shared documents in agent_tasks as a form of memory and passive coordination layer.

First, list the proposed agents for the user's review and approval. Then, ultrathink and write a detailed execution plan that can be expanded and progress summaries noted by multiple agents, as well as a place to provide references to external files that document their individual work product and findings.
