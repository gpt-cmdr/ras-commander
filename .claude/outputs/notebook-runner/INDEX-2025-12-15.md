## Recommendations

### For Continuous Testing
These notebooks are suitable for automated regression testing:
- Deterministic output (same results each run)
- Fast execution (~13-17s total)
- No external dependencies (bundled examples)
- Comprehensive API coverage

### For Documentation
Both notebooks serve dual purpose:
- User-facing examples and tutorials
- Functional validation of core APIs
- Integration testing of key workflows

### For CI/CD Integration
Recommended CI/CD approach:
```bash
# Add to GitHub Actions or similar
pytest --nbmake examples/01_project_initialization.ipynb examples/00_Using_RasExamples.ipynb
```

## Issues and Notes

### No Critical Issues Found
- ✓ Zero execution errors
- ✓ Zero missing dependencies
- ✓ Zero data validation failures

### Minor Notes
1. **ZMQ Asyncio Warning** (HARMLESS)
   - Expected on Windows with Jupyter
   - Does not affect execution
   - No action required

2. **DataFrame Display Width** (EXPECTED)
   - Some DataFrames truncated in console output
   - Normal Jupyter behavior
   - Does not affect data availability

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions
1. Add both notebooks to automated CI/CD pipeline
2. Schedule weekly regression testing
3. Update notebook testing plan (Notebook_Testing_and_QAQC.md) with results
4. Archive successful test run for reference

### Future Testing
- [ ] Test with local development version (USE_LOCAL_SOURCE = True)
- [ ] Test on macOS/Linux platforms
- [ ] Test with HEC-RAS 6.5 and earlier versions
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking
- [ ] Expand to additional example notebooks
