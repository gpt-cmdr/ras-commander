WHAT THIS NOTEBOOK VALIDATES
================================================================================
1. RasExamples.extract_project() - Example project extraction
2. init_ras_project() - Global project initialization
3. RasPrj() - Multiple independent project objects
4. DataFrame structures - plan_df, geom_df, boundaries_df, etc.
5. RASMapper parsing - Configuration file parsing
6. Multiple project workflows - Managing 3+ projects simultaneously

DATA QUALITY
================================================================================
- Project paths: Valid absolute paths ✓
- DataFrames: Correct column structure ✓
- Boundary conditions: 3 conditions with complete metadata ✓
- Plans: Multiple plans accessible ✓
- Geometry: Successfully parsed and stored ✓

COMPATIBILITY
================================================================================
- HEC-RAS Version: 6.6 (using Example_Projects_6_6.zip)
- Platform: Windows
- Python Version: 3.x
- Package Mode: pip-installed (USE_LOCAL_SOURCE = False)

CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================
The notebook successfully demonstrates all core project initialization workflows:
- Extracting bundled example projects
- Initializing projects for use
- Exploring project metadata
- Managing multiple projects simultaneously

The notebook is suitable for:
- User documentation and learning
- Functional regression testing
- Integration testing
- CI/CD automated testing

STATUS: READY FOR PRODUCTION USE
