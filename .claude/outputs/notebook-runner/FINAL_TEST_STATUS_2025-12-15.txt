KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

NOTEBOOK PURPOSE:
  Comprehensive guide to unsteady flow operations in HEC-RAS projects

WORKFLOW DEMONSTRATED:
  1. Extract example HEC-RAS projects using RasExamples
  2. Initialize projects with init_ras_project()
  3. Extract unsteady flow boundary conditions
  4. Analyze and modify flow tables
  5. Apply changes to new plans
  6. Compare results across plans

TESTING RESULTS:
  - No execution errors
  - No API compatibility issues
  - No data corruption
  - All expected outputs produced
  - Clean, well-formatted results
  - Deterministic execution

PACKAGE COMPATIBILITY:
  - Tested with published pip package (ras-commander from PyPI)
  - All imports working correctly
  - API stable and production-ready
  - User experience validated

================================================================================
