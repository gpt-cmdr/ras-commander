Title: Single Plan Execution

NOTEBOOK STRUCTURE:
  - Markdown cells: 11
  - Code cells: 11

NOTEBOOK PURPOSE:
  - Let's set up our working directory and paths to example projects. We'll also check the number of available CPU cores on this system.
  - Before we dive into execution, let's understand the `compute_plan` method from the `RasCmdr` class, which is the core function for running HEC-RAS simulations.
  - - `plan_number` (str, Path): The plan number to execute or the full path to the plan file
  - - `dest_folder` (str, Path, optional): Destination folder for computation
  - - `ras_object` (RasPrj, optional): Specific RAS object to use (defaults to global `ras`)

EXECUTION RESULTS:
  - Total outputs: 51
  - Errors: 0
  - Status: PASS
