## Why Workspace?

Moved to `/workspace` to keep active development work separate from completed outputs. The workspace allows for:

- ✅ Iterative development without cluttering `.claude/outputs/`
- ✅ Organized work products (design, implementation, tests)
- ✅ Clear separation of planning vs delivery
- ✅ Easy cleanup when work is integrated into codebase
